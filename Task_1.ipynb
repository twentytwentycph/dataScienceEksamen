where do see stock price head near greg weldon: yeah, i mean it' perfect question becaus realiti is, we our daili research we focus this, fact yesterday. we haven't spoken ... sound like we arrang question. focus fact gold, rel at low. realli kind low we'v seen before, but at level where if get much lower, you'r break down low whole thing get call into question from technic perspective. but my problem look at from technic perspective, i think stock market live borrow times. basically, fed ha done exactli what they want do. they have peopl out safe into risk assets. that' whole idea qe. stock market. ha facilit unpreced rise consum credit. instead hous market be collater like wa <num>, now it' stock market that' world world. have demand be driven or realli be fed by credit. now see credit number start slow. they'r start see consum roll over littl bit. so that' number one risk stock it' actual if look at retail sale outsid which don't have much anything. have eat drink growth that' key key layer discretionari spend that' an import tell bigger picture. consum discretionari sector break down against so that' warn sign me. have, term dynam around what expect gdp growth, upon polici have not yet been even agre upon, let alon vote upon, let alon let alon start work. so, i worri about kind fractur between expectations, level stock investors, diminish diminish i think there' stock market risk. that' one reason we like gold, becaus what would go hand hand that, wa some kind mayb statement or pull back dot plot from fed would then caus dollar come off it littl ralli here. mike gleason: let' play devil' advoc mayb littl here. we look at these record stock price wonder about what beyond high valuat past when hit these levels, wa signal market were near top. but there' one big differ between past today: advent high frequenc trading. huge amount daili volum gener by trade game these program don't sens risk an emot level like human trader do. they respond veri differ geopolit events. so, if today' market seem from reality, perhap becaus it' becaus they are. now have been front trade these market decades. were wit how market have transform recent years. what your take high frequenc trade what doe say about possibl current equiti market valuat can sustain or mayb even push what your thought there, greg? greg weldon: that' phenomen question it' veri well time given we did big special septemb call which shift fed polici here. but if take now your question, which pertin now, look at experience, my experi over decades, bring back right off we'r not say go crash. there clearli there lot differences. but when ask about high frequenc trading, sound me, first thing i think of, portfolio insur time time ten so, risk term just what catalyst then caus kind cascad one thing we'v been point out our by way, i'm work out gigant special show just how intrigu some similar around movement dollar, movement bonds, movement gold, movement stocks, some even down crude oil, fed polici now there wa basic from onc they kick accord, which dollar. lot intrigu connect there special report i'm write this, it' call me which we'd love make avail ani your first all, if they want email me. but term set up, again i think lay wait out there. i think if take an example, one things, like i said we'v been tell our if take amazon or google. stock trade at $<num> share. need $<num> buy one share. so, volum trade ha diminish dramat over last coupl year stock price ha gone up. it' it' manag doesn't matter, doesn't term what type peopl who want own these stocks, own them. dynam between price level be so high, buy up block amount money needed, pure simple, against me, set up someth like you'r talk about would exacerb by flash crash. so, becom veri scari term what kind meltdown could see if get ball roll i still think someth will play out over some time. i think fed there. i don't think ... there lot differences. i'm not tri make direct '<num> comparison. but i'll tell what, risk there. no doubt about it. risk mike gleason: term fed here, greg, what your think who might talk over janet yellen next fed chair then also, tell us what think they'r go do here term get inflat where they basically, what your gener thought fed fed monetari policy? clearli favorit subject. greg weldon: really, it' two total separ question right now becaus who donald trump go pick versu how inflat go play out. i think if look at what fed saying, fed ha been veri clear. where powel what seem be, i'm not say i believ this, i'm just say seem logic choic if, if, your goal maintain policy. think about bring guy like taylor, taylor rule where natur level fed fund should here, he would obvious much more hawkish choice. while him trump might have realli gotten along, mayb there' lot trump can learn from him, i don't think that' guy trump want term polici tri get hi growth agenda going. context, how maintain which realli isn't bad. they'r certainli not tight they'r not tighten ani nth it' almost materi here, inflat powel logic choic becaus make headlin which cours he basic make change, but kind keep statu quo. other one would he wa more away from toward just use interest rates. he' an interest kind dark horse. yellen certainli dark horse. what realli how doe fed decid they'r go deal inflat issu when they can't even decid what' caus it? becaus keep hear these word be use repeatedly, over over over again you'v had one fed offici go so far as, even yellen herself ha made comment effect of, \"we don't understand whi it' not again, kind back taylor basic rule thumb fed on, i.e. hope for, labor market continu tighten inflat will go up will support gener rise question now becom natur rate unemploy lower than we thought was. or, there structur differ now, base dynam labor market ha out labor market, reason still have particip rate while final up little, still so low historically, therein lie question. what kind keep inflat back how doe play i think employ number from month, september, were huge sens wa biggest wage number ... know how i break number down. nth wa real deal. onli one month, but still real deal, best wage number we'v seen sinc <num>. so, will continue?

background regard ukraine, russia run-up new cold war. i'v been work print broadcast about onset new cold war sinc late <num> becaus i saw clinton administration' polici then russia gener backlash would lead two countri or continu <num>-year cold war reagan gorbachev then first presid bush said they had end <num>-<num> ha more or less worst way i worri about. i don't think anybodi would deni they we'r new cold war. i think they'r slow acknowledg it' even more danger variou way reason than wa <num>-year cold war. but one reason wa not case dure old cold war we militarili russia three new cold war one, course, ukrain which way but becaus nato' i think reckless militari buildup russia' western border particularli baltic region region but also certain extent syria where situat veri fluid still dangerous. cold war could erupt into an actual hot war veri i guess though danger seem mayb year ago would first foremost syria becaus ukrain sinc seem rather frozen. now it' back ukraine. we'v got stop think what means. ukrain nation then state follow end soviet union wa alway histor economic, polit simpli hold ukrain togeth state wa go problem but everyon wasn't pretti but they manag until event when we all rememb maidan protest let' rememb what they were elect presid ukraine, viktor declin sign so-cal european union partnership agreement. wa just said econom wa said would bring ukrain into european civil cours away from russia. now ukrain russia had been bound at peopl don't mention often but there ten million it' hard not go moscow spend some time not find someon who' got ukrainian russian parent or but happen also need remov remind yanukovych did not sign agreement. he simpli ask more time. but set off protest driven by all sort people. some democrat seek liberals, fine peopl ukraine, but also by peopl who were by ani definit even led cours confront where yanukovych wa driven off. new, illeg govern wa form back by unit state europe. russia variou reason i think were legitim fear would spread histor russian peninsula crimea which most it histori centuri had been part russia. but becaus kind wa now part ukraine. russian therefor welcom encourag referendum crimea. by all standard includ poll were taken later, more than percent vote join russia. so russia legal don't call they call crimea. meanwhile, mostli russian provinc part crimea coup kiev had overthrown president. they had vote yanukovych. hi elector wa not onli southeastern ukrain but wa primarili there. so they believ their presid had been overthrown rebellion began back by russia course. war ha gone now nearli four years. offici number dead but it' sure mani more perhap million peopl who live southeastern ukrain have been displac most them gone russia. incidentally, russia get no credit veri humanitarian way they have handl all these people, refuge who russia. now cours wa easier becaus they were russian but great mani them have their lives. term their famili russia. whether they'll ever go back ukrain not clear. so that' where situat wa kind frozen. there wa agreement know call minsk agreement all european power agre there. presid ukraine, poroshenko, agre putin agre too resolut crisis. call two along design line fight kiev' agreement donbass would given home rule. remain within what would essenti ukrainian state. no one ha ever suggest better or altern solut that. dure year sinc minsk wa <num>, by all evid seem both side have violat agreement. but kiev ha refus grant ani home rule provinc we know from histori whether it' from civil war or other divers countri onli way save state make federation. but opposit ukrain among enormous. presid weak both person leader term hi public support at home. unit state ha done noth encourag real implic so remain hot one could imagin all sort bad outcom becaus it' now proxi war donbass were back by russia. kiev back by unit state proxi war could becom direct war. final point ha been long but when ever sinc obama wa tri figur out what do about ukraine. idea unit state send more higher qualiti weapon kiev. suppress rebellion donbass though formal said ward off new russian attack which there no evid or obama refus do heavi he wa under enorm pressur especi from liber wing democrat parti which ha becom veri hawkish he refus do that. seem clear from donald trump' campaign he would never do becaus he want cooper russia. yet he ha been i think agre send weapon kiev when what they'll send isn't yet clear but he can onli make matter wors realli matter worse. that' where we today. discuss then turn present day. narr west russia seiz crimea some sort where putin must stop he desper tri border old soviet union. at we have alway felt wa bogu fail acknowledg ani context from russian point view. professor cohen situat from russian point view wa even worse. i mean understand have know russian history, know russian know historically, wa such part russia so mani centuri right through soviet period would bit stretch if say texa becaus onc not nativ part america. but even more becaus cultur crimea. site, i mean home wa it' icon russian history, russian cultur russian sentiment. wasn't just naval base at which wa vital important, although russian which had been naval base by way what happen at maidan call into question whether kiev would honor long term leas ani longer. you'r absolut right about that. russia wa build far north an altern naval base. i mean technic could have replic crimea strateg could have done but could never have replic crimea heart mind russians. and, poll after poll referendum show heart mind some percent people. now crimea also ha crimean ukrainian who don't share view. but overwhelm major crimean who were born there or move there or live there decades, wa their sentiment. now here' polit background. all year i'v follow post soviet russia, begin <num>, i never saw ani kremlin leadership give ani indic wa go take crimea back. let me repeat that. could not certainli not public know know these kind peopl have pentagon elsewher secretli dark night. but neither nor putin ever gave ani public support idea which could find moscow some intellectu circl know, crimea fact, at one point they need draw new map becaus crimea wa now no longer russia after <num>. putin wrote presid don't recal which one wa say our map peopl want get new map could get your map peopl work them becaus there' number border aren't clear we'v got clarifi he got no response. other words, notion crimea might taken or even back into russia simpli wa not polit agenda kremlin under putin until <num>. final segment discuss deal futur . + more specifically, what if anyth can done by everyday effect chang war parti from path professor cohen had some thought there, too. i'm not trump support i didn't vote him. however, we can actual support donald trump' campaign promis which i think he' tri act sinc he' been presid it' necessari cooper russia. what wa

could american democraci replac totalitarian rule? there' enough resembl yale historian timothi snyder, who studi fascist communist regim chang totalitarian rule, ha written book warn about threat offer lesson resist survival. author twenti lesson from centuri talk steven steven three week ago, said countri ha perhap year defend american said what happen next few week crucial. more concern than ever our polit cultur institut toward fascism, resembl key aspect earli european regim you'v timothi let me answer three parts. first thing lesson i wrote, i wrote novemb <num>th. book, tyranny, wa done by christmas. which mean if peopl read now, peopl read it, it' describ world they in, mean i'v success made base history. we'r go talk about what go but i want point out wa basic complet but book doe describ what go now. year figur there becaus we have recogn thing move fast. nazi germani took about year. took about two half years. poland got rid judiciari within year. it' histor but point becaus there an outsid therefor have act now. have get start it' just veri practic it' thing out reach you, psycholog veri quickly, then legal almost quickly. it' hard peopl act when they feel other peopl won't act. it' hard peopl act when they feel like they have break law do so. so import get out front befor peopl face those psycholog legal am i more worri now? i realiz wa your question. no, i'm exactli worri i wa before, november. i think peopl who inhabit white hous inhabit differ ideolog world which they would like unit state not constitut system now is. i wa concern about november. i'm concern about now. noth ha happen sinc ha chang way i see things. sr: let' talk about how evolut take place. you'v written about how 'post-truth talk about leader ignor facts, law history. how far along we? i'm wonder where might see thing go next. ts: that' tough becaus what histori doe give whole bunch case where democrat republ becom authoritarian sometim fascist sometim communist regimes. doesn't give one a, give bunch cluster a, bunch cluster c. but realli import more import than peopl becaus it' regim change. we think about democracy, that' word american love use, democracy, that' how we character our system. but if democraci just mean go vote, it' pretti russia ha democraci sense. most authoritarian regim have democraci sense. nazi germani had democraci sense, even after system had fundament changed. democraci onli ha substanc if there' rule law. is, if peopl believ vote go count they if they believ there' judiciari out there will make sens thing if there' some challenge. if there isn't rule law, peopl will afraid vote way they want vote. they'll vote their own safeti oppos their so thing we call democraci depend rule law. thing we call rule law depend upon law function percent time automatically. function becaus we think it' out there. that, turn, depend sens truth. so there' mechan here. can get right heart matter if can convinc peopl there no truth. which whi stuff we character might dismiss actual really, realli essential. second thing about 'post-truth i'm tri get people' attention, becaus actual how fascism works. fascism says, disregard evid your disregard deed can't proven, don't have faith god but have faith leaders, take part collect an organ nation unity, so forth. fascism wa precis about set whole enlighten asid then sell what sort myth now those myth pretti unpredictable, conting differ nation differ leader so on, but just set fact asid actual fastest catalyst. so part concern me lot. where we'r going? classic thing watch out shift from one govern strategi u.s. system, typic govern strategi more or less have follow your constitu legisl becaus elect cycle. that' one puls politics. other puls polit there' some kind terrorist attack then leader tri basic constitut rights. then we get differ where not one elector cycl next but one emerg next. that' how regim chang take place. it' classic way sinc reichstag fire burn their nation' capitol build blame communist so term what might happen next, or what peopl could look out for, some kind event govern claim terrorist incident, would someth prepar for. that' whi it' one lesson book. sr: have talk befor about kind emerg even vladimir putin russia. what think would happen becaus except lot american institutions, like congress, not realli they'r go ts: they'r go but my own would emerg situat aris becaus go along isn't go enough. congress go along go pass bunch stuff, which not actual veri popular. right? it' not go so popular have million peopl lose health insurance, which what' go happen. iron thing about republican congress now ha abil do everyth want do, but none what want do popular. except few big lobbies, course. freedom republican have freedom impos their agenda down. same thing goe mr. trump. thing he might do some peopl would like, like build wall or drive all immigr out, those thing go difficult or slow. case wall, i person don't believ will ever happen. it' go veri slow. so my suspicion much easier have dramat neg event, than have dramat posit event. one reason i am concern about reichstag fire scenario. other reason we be mental prepar by all talk about terror by muslim ban. veri often when leader repeat thing over over they prepar when meme actual reality. sr: i want chang topic cite mani exampl from germani <num>, year hitler power. so what did ordinari german miss that' relev ordinari american now? i know some facts. but when i have talk holocaust they often say, nobodi ever thought thing would bad, or nobodi thought german would go far they did. ts: german jew then, peopl now, don't understand how quick their neighbor will don't understand how quickli societi can change. they don't understand fact life that' been predict long time, doesn't mean will predict tomorrow. peopl like think their experi german jew might have 'well, there were russia, but sure noth like could happen here.' that' what mani german jew thought. so one issu peopl need realiz how quickli thing can change. second thing german jew were not awar of, or german were not awar of, wa how new media can quickli chang conversations. way, it' not exactli same, but radio at time often end up be channel propaganda. there parallel internet now, where there were hope would enlightening. but fact, turn out presidenti or or isol habit isn't necessarili enlightening. it' opposite. lot us were blindsid by internet much same way peopl could blindsid by radio <num>s. but here' other view. one we have german jew didn't have we have their experience. that' premis whole premis <num>th centuri show us what can happen, there' lot wonder by german historian others, which break down what can happen how. so, one first thing we should do take advantag one opportun we realli have they which learn from history. that' premis book. sr: all your book' lesson veri don't obey advance. believ truth. stand out. defend institutions. calm but can be. yet chang or talk about what do say peopl who say, try, but i may not have power here.' there' tilt at ... ts: well, if everyon against would fall down, right? parti he' tilt against wrong thing. so that' not our problem. we'r pretti sure what problem is. but he wa also alon except hi faith we'r not realli alone. there million million peopl who look thing do. just by sheer if everyon doe littl thing, will make difference. much what i am recommend right, they thing peopl can do, but they also involv some kind engagement. whether it' small talk [with those disagre or whether it' politics. littl bit engag help realiz what do ha kind sense, even if doesn't immedi chang order. finally, lot polit theori i am call upon, which come from make point even though don't realiz it, your own exampl matter whole lot, whether it' posit or there times, one those times, where small or their can make huge difference. so thing might not have year ago do matter now. basic thing we make differ whether we realiz or not, basic question whether posit or negative. let me put differ way. except realli dramat most time depend some kind cycl involv popular consent some form. realli doe matter how we danger we say, 'well, we don't see how matters, so therefor we go just tabl whole if we do that, then we start slide along start do thing author expect us. which whi lesson number one is: don't obey advance. have set tabl differently. have say, 'thi situat which i need think myself about all thing i am go do not just not just nor just see how thing seem me. becaus if do that, then chang actual becom part regim chang toward sr: cite book someth i read high ionesco' existenti play about fascism, where peopl talk about their colleagu at work, academia, say stuff like, on, i don't agre everything, but give him chance.' ionesco' point peopl join an herd befor they know it. what would suggest peopl do, when they run into other who fall ts: there few question here. one how keep yourself going. anoth how energ other peopl who agre you. third thing not quit rhinocero stuff, but how catch peopl who like cnn coverag last week speech congress, where one cnn said, now wa rhinocero moment, becaus there wa noth wa atroci parad victim commit by one wa atroci there' noth presidenti about it. rhinocero moment one thing. i think it' realli import think about. exampl give peopl saying, 'yeah, one hand, jews, mayb they right.' trump, peopl will say someth like, 'yeah, but taxes, mayb he' right.' thing catch is, 'yeah, but favor regim change? favor end american way democraci fair becaus that' what' realli at stake. peopl all way over at end spectrum who now confid about differ subject. i think it' import maintain imposs human relat across becaus some those peopl go chang their minds. it' but some will chang their minds, if they have no one talk to, will much harder them chang their minds. at differ point have think differ ways. my own major concern right now energi peopl who do have i think someth ha gone wildli wrong. sr: peopl who have convict someth ha gone wildli can describ trump support trump ts: that' good point. so much personal. book, i don't actual mention name, except who i so much person peopl think, 'well, if say anyth critical, about person, how don't like anyth about someon who like that' way there no polit i think it' useful, even though will never win argument, when talk about peopl who support administration, stay at level constitution. stay at level freedom, or stay at level basic issues, like, global warm realli go so great, when entir pentagon say nation secur threat? or, realli such good idea treat muslim like this? or, realli go so good when million peopl lose health keep at level issu much possible, becaus what i'v found pattern peopl shift is, 'whi go so hard give him chance.' but issu what' what actual american, what' go polici they go proud year from convers closest constitution. it' dismiss when it' personal. isn't personal. doesn't matter who' charge. what matter system, which peopl veri differ take granted, now under threat. sr: have said muslim be target jew were target germany. but out here california, also feel like deport get readi undocu immigrants. monday, reuter report homeland secur offici said they might separ mother from kid when make germani did round up jews. don't they face just grave threat? ts: muslims, resembl polici germani '<num> if can pick some group make them stand some intern threat, then can chang domest politics, becaus domest polit then no longer about compromis compet interests, domest polit about who insid societi should actual seen outsid society. onc get first group, them essenti win. could muslims. could somebodi else, point. polit logic basic same. undocu immigrants, i think logic might littl bit different. i think goal might get us use see certain kind polic power. get us use see thing happen peopl public. then if we get use that, then we might more will turn littl bit further. it' too soon me confid about all this. i think you'r right though, could muslims, but doesn't have muslims. crucial thing get some kind where peopl go along or accept logic there' alway some kind threat come from beyond country. we can fix threat group peopl insid country. if go along this, what els agre go along with? sr: go back your book, what you'r say peopl should should know their valu particip at some level make those valu known, becaus what ordinari peopl can do. ts: yes. point book we face real crisi real moment choice. possibl much darker than american use but at same time, what we can do much more import than we realize. regim will onli chang if gambl peopl white hous mani us mani other us most us if turn out there emot valu more numer more vibrant than thing go depend us. depend us make certain depend us act fast. sens it' test, not just mayb there' no such thing collect but test us most american who haven't been abroad haven't been face by someth like this. hope they won't face again. but we face citizen individuals. i think, five or year from now, no matter how thing turn out, we'll ask our children will ask we <num>. <date> <date> <date> if we don't act now, fascism will our doorstep, say yale historian nan [''] timothi snyder histori give us bunch case where democrat republ becam authoritarian regimes. how close presid donald trump follow path blaze by last century' tyrants?
