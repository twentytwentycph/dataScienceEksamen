where do see stock price head near term? greg weldon: yeah, i mean it' perfect question becaus realiti is, we our daili research we focus this, fact yesterday. we haven't spoken ... sound like we arrang question. focus fact gold, rel s&p, at low. realli kind low we'v seen before, but at level where if get much lower, you'r break down multi-year low whole thing get call into question from technic perspective. but my problem look at from technic perspective, i think stock market live borrow times. basically, fed ha done exactli what they want do. they have flush peopl out safe haven into risk assets. that' whole idea qe. worked. reflat stock market. ha facilit huge, unpreced rise consum credit. instead hous market be collater like wa 2006 2007, now it' stock market that' collateral, googl amazon world facebook world. have demand be driven or realli be fed by credit. now see credit number start slow. they'r unsustainable. start see consum roll over littl bit. so that' number one risk stock market; it' actual consumer. if look at retail sale numbers, outsid automobil gasoline, which price-based, don't have much anything. have eat drink growth slowing. that' key component, key layer discretionari spend that' an import tell bigger picture. consum discretionari sector break down against s&p. so that' warn sign me. have, term dynam around what expect gdp growth, predic upon polici have not yet been even agre upon, let alon vote upon, let alon implemented, let alon start work. so, i worri about kind fractur between expectations, patienc level stock investors, diminish returns, diminish volumes. i think there' stock market risk. that' one reason we like gold, becaus what would go hand hand that, wa some kind mayb statement or pull back dot plot from fed would then caus dollar come off it littl ralli here. mike gleason: let' play devil' advoc mayb littl here. we look at these record stock price wonder about what beyond extraordinarili high valuat past when pe ratio hit these levels, wa signal market were near top. but there' one big differ between past today: advent high frequenc machine-driven trading. huge amount daili volum gener by trade algorithms. game changer. these program don't sens risk an emot level like human trader do. they respond veri differ geopolit events. so, if today' market seem disconnect from reality, perhap becaus it' becaus they are. now have been front lines, trade these market decades. were wit how market have transform recent years. what your take high frequenc algorithm trade what doe say about possibl current equiti market valuat can sustain or mayb even push higher? what your thought there, greg? greg weldon: that' phenomen question it' veri well time given we did big special septemb call \"shrinkage,\" which shift fed polici here. but if take now your question, which pertin now, look at experience, my experi over decades, bring back 1987 right off bat. we'r not say market' go crash. there clearli there lot differences. but when ask about high frequenc trading, sound me, first thing i think of, portfolio insur steroids, time thousand, time ten thousand. so, risk term just what catalyst then caus kind cascad downside? one thing we'v been point out our customers... by way, i'm work out gigant special show just how intrigu some similar around movement dollar, movement bonds, movement gold, movement stocks, some ratios, even down crude oil, fed polici cpi. now there wa basic from 1985 '87, onc they kick plaza accord, which depreci dollar. lot intrigu connect there special report i'm write this, it' call \"what, me worry?\" which we'd love make avail ani your listeners, first all, if they want email me. but term catalyst, set up, again i think landmin lay wait out there. i think if take an example, one things, like i said we'v been tell our customers, if take amazon or google. stock trade at $1,000 share. need $1,000 buy one share. so, volum trade ha diminish dramat over last coupl year stock price ha gone up. ownership huge. it' passive, it' manag investments, doesn't matter, doesn't discrimin term what type investor. peopl who want own these stocks, own them. dynam between price level be so high, nomin speaking, buy up block shares, amount money needed, pure simple, against volume, me, set up someth like you'r talk about would exacerb by flash crash. so, becom veri scari term what kind meltdown could see if get ball roll downside. i still think someth will play out over some time. i think fed there. i don't think ... there lot differences. i'm not tri make direct '87 comparison. but i'll tell what, risk there. no doubt about it. risk rising. mike gleason: term fed here, greg, what your think who might talk over janet yellen next fed chair then also, tell us what think they'r go do here term get inflat where they want? basically, what your gener thought fed fed monetari policy? clearli everyone' favorit subject. greg weldon: really, it' two total separ question right now becaus who donald trump go pick versu how inflat go play out. i think if look at what fed saying, fed ha been veri clear. where (jerome) powel becomes, what seem be, i'm not say i believ this, i'm just say seem powell' logic choic if, if, your goal maintain policy. think about bring guy like (john) taylor, taylor rule where natur level fed fund should here, he would obvious much more hawkish choice. while him trump might have realli gotten along, mayb there' lot trump can learn from him, i don't think that' guy trump want term polici tri get hi growth agenda going. context, how maintain continuity, which realli isn't bad. they'r certainli not tight they'r not tighten ani nth degree. it' almost goldilock materi here, inflat aside. powel logic choic becaus make headlin splash, which cours he loves. basic make change, but kind keep statu quo. other one would (kevin) warsh. he wa more away from qe toward just use interest rates. he' an interest kind dark horse. yellen certainli dark horse. what matt realli how doe fed decid they'r go deal inflat issu when they can't even decid what' caus it? becaus keep hear transitory, idiosyncratic. these word be use repeatedly, over over over again describe, you'v had one fed offici go so far as, even yellen herself ha made comment effect of, \"we don't understand whi it' not materializing.\" again, kind back taylor model, basic rule thumb fed count on, i.e. hope for, labor market continu tighten wages, inflat will go up will support gener rise prices. question now becom natur rate unemploy lower than we thought was. or, there structur differ now, technolog base dynam labor market ha hollow out labor market, reason still have particip rate while final up little, still so low historically, therein lie question. what kind keep inflat back how doe play out? i think employ number from month, september, were huge sens wa biggest wage number ... know how i break number down. nth degree, wa real deal. onli one month, but still real deal, best wage number we'v seen sinc 2007. so, will continue? we know anecdot evid there. will continu over next coupl months? if look at cpi ppi, pipeline, year-over-year dynam around some commodities, god forbid, grains, oil seeds, tropic commod start ralli becaus then you'd have real problem. look at what base model doing. look at what energi potenti you'r go break out here. so, i think there some inflat come it' apt push fed have rais meet their dot plots, i think that' go problemat equiti markets. they'r walk high wire act no safeti net. it' veri difficult job. mike gleason: get back metal here bit. we would like give our listen an updat silver gold price rig scandal erupt year half ago when deutsch bank wa forc acknowledg cheat turn over mountain evidence, which may prove damn number other banks. but court regul have record move slowly, if they do anyth at all. now you'r much closer futur market than we are. awar ani develop front what do see implic civil action against bullion banks?

greg weldon: i have sens it' busi usual. i get sens it' kind laissez fair attitud about becaus problem so big, if we were actual kind get unearthed, impact would much, much larger we would know base price section veri quickly. it' powder keg. it'll blow at some point. something, gosh i'v been busi how long, we'v been talk about how long?

it' not onli my duti american presid pursu cooper ward off catastroph but i commend honor tradit republican party\". he doesn't say that. i don't know whi i say becaus he doesn't know what or becaus

could american democraci replac totalitarian rule? there' enough resembl yale historian timothi snyder, who studi fascist communist regim chang totalitarian rule, ha written book warn about threat offer lesson resist survival. author tyranny: twenti lesson from twentieth centuri talk alternet' steven rosenfeld. steven rosenfeld: three week ago, said countri ha perhap year 'to defend american democracy.' said what happen next few week crucial. more concern than ever our polit cultur institut evolv toward fascism, resembl key aspect earli 20th-centuri european regim you'v studied? timothi snyder: let me answer three parts. first thing 20 lesson i wrote, i wrote novemb 15th. book, tyranny, wa done by christmas. which mean if peopl read now, peopl read it, it' describ world they in, mean i'v success made predict base history. we'r go talk about what go come, but i want point out timeline--it wa basic complet blind. but book doe describ what go now. year figur there becaus we have recogn thing move fast. nazi germani took about year. hungari took about two half years. poland got rid top-level judiciari within year. it' rough histor guess, but point becaus there an outsid limit, therefor have act now. have get start early. it' just veri practic advice. it' meta-advic past: thing slip out reach you, psycholog veri quickly, then legal almost quickly. it' hard peopl act when they feel other peopl won't act. it' hard peopl act when they feel like they have break law do so. so import get out front befor peopl face those psycholog legal barriers. am i more worri now? i realiz wa your question. no, i'm exactli worri i wa before, november. i think peopl who inhabit white hous inhabit differ ideolog world which they would like unit state not constitut system now is. i wa concern about november. i'm concern about now. noth ha happen sinc ha chang way i see things. sr: let' talk about how evolut take place. you'v written about how 'post-truth pre-fascism.' talk about leader ignor facts, law history. how far along progress we? i'm wonder where might see thing go next. ts: that' tough becaus what histori doe give whole bunch case where democrat republ becom authoritarian regimes; sometim fascist regimes, sometim communist regimes. doesn't give one storyline: a, b, c, d. give bunch cluster a, bunch cluster c. but factual realli import more import than peopl realize, becaus it' substructur regim change. we think about democracy, that' word american love use, democracy, that' how we character our system. but if democraci just mean go vote, it' pretti meaningless. russia ha democraci sense. most authoritarian regim have democraci sense. nazi germani had democraci sense, even after system had fundament changed. democraci onli ha substanc if there' rule law. is, if peopl believ vote go count they counted. if they believ there' judiciari out there will make sens thing if there' some challenge. if there isn't rule law, peopl will afraid vote way they want vote. they'll vote their own safeti oppos their convictions. so thing we call democraci depend rule law. thing we call rule law depend upon trust. law function 99 percent time automatically. function becaus we think it' out there. that, turn, depend sens truth. so there' mechan here. can get right heart matter if can convinc peopl there no truth. which whi stuff we character post-modern might dismiss actual really, realli essential. second thing about 'post-truth pre-fascism' i'm tri get people' attention, becaus actual how fascism works. fascism says, disregard evid your senses, disregard observation, embolden deed can't proven, don't have faith god but have faith leaders, take part collect myth an organ nation unity, so forth. fascism wa precis about set whole enlighten asid then sell what sort myth emerged. now those [national] myth pretti unpredictable, conting differ nation differ leader so on, but just set fact asid actual fastest catalyst. so part concern me lot. where we'r going? classic thing watch out shift from one govern strategi another. u.s. system, typic govern strategi more or less have follow your constitu legisl becaus elect cycle. that' one puls politics. other puls polit emergency. there' some kind terrorist attack then leader tri suspend basic constitut rights. then we get differ rhythm, where rhythm not one elector cycl next but one emerg next. that' how regim chang take place. it' classic way sinc reichstag fire [when nazi burn their nation' capitol build blame communist arsonists]. so term what might happen next, or what peopl could look out for, some kind event govern claim terrorist incident, would someth prepar for. that' whi it' one lesson book. sr: have talk befor about kind emerg justification--and even vladimir putin russia. what think would happen here? becaus except judiciary, lot american institutions, like congress, not realli resisting. they'r go along. ts: they'r go along... but my own intuit would emerg situat aris becaus go along isn't go enough. paradoxically, congress go along go pass bunch stuff, which not actual veri popular. right? it' not go so popular have million peopl lose health insurance, which what' go happen. iron thing about republican congress now ha abil do everyth want do, but none what want do popular. except few big lobbies, course. freedom republican have freedom impos their agenda down. same thing goe mr. trump. thing he might do some peopl would like, like build wall or drive all immigr out, those thing go difficult or slow. case wall, i person don't believ will ever happen. it' go veri slow. so my suspicion much easier have dramat neg event, than have dramat posit event. one reason i am concern about reichstag fire scenario. other reason we be mental prepar by all talk about terror by muslim ban. veri often when leader repeat thing over over they prepar when meme actual emerg reality. sr: i want chang topic slightly. cite mani exampl from germani 1933, year hitler consolid power. so what did ordinari german miss that' relev ordinari american now? i know some blur facts. but when i have talk holocaust survivors, they often say, nobodi ever thought thing would bad, or nobodi thought german would go far they did. ts: german jew then, peopl now, don't understand how quick their neighbor will change; don't understand how quickli societi can change. they don't understand fact life that' been predict long time, doesn't mean will predict tomorrow. peopl like think their experi exceptional. german jew might have thought, 'well, there were pogrom [ethnic cleansing] russia, but sure noth like could happen here.' that' what mani german jew thought. so one issu peopl need realiz how quickli thing can change. second thing german jew were not awar of, or german were not awar of, wa how new media can quickli chang conversations. way, it' not exactli same, but radio at time often end up be channel propaganda. there parallel internet now, where there were hope would [primarily] enlightening. but fact, turn out presidenti tweets, or bots, or isol habit viewing, isn't necessarili enlightening. it' opposite. lot us were blindsid by internet much same way peopl could blindsid by radio 1930s. but here' other view. one we have german jew didn't have 1933 we have their experience. that' premis whole book; premis 20th centuri show us what can happen, there' lot wonder scholarship by german historian others, which break down what can happen how. so, one first thing we should do take advantag one opportun we realli have they didn't, which learn from history. that' premis book. sr: all your book' lesson veri personal: don't obey advance. believ truth. stand out. defend institutions. calm but courag can be. yet chang or oppress talk about system institutional. what do say peopl who say, 'i'll try, but i may not have power here.' there' cliche, tilt at windmills. ... ts: well, if everyon tilt against windmill, windmil would fall down, right? parti tragedi don quixot he' tilt against wrong thing. so that' not our problem. we'r pretti sure what problem is. but he wa also alon except hi faith companion. we'r not realli alone. there million million peopl who look thing do. just by sheer math, if everyon doe littl thing, will make difference. much what i am recommend is--you'r right, they thing peopl can do, but they also involv some kind engagement. whether it' small talk [with those disagre with] or whether it' corpor politics. littl bit engag help realiz what do ha kind sense, even if doesn't immedi chang order. finally, lot polit theori i am call upon, which come from anti-nazi anti-communists, make point even though don't realiz it, your own exampl matter whole lot, whether it' posit or negatively. there times, one those times, where small gestures, or their absence, can make huge difference. so thing might not have matter year ago do matter now. basic thing we make differ whether we realiz or not, basic question whether posit or negative. let me put differ way. except realli dramat moments, most time authoritarian depend some kind cycl involv popular consent some form. realli doe matter how we behave. danger [if] we say, 'well, we don't see how matters, so therefor we go just tabl whole question.' if we do that, then we start slide along start do thing author expect us. which whi lesson number one is: don't obey advance. have set tabl differently. have say, 'thi situat which i need think myself about all thing i am go do not just punt. not just wait. nor just see how thing seem me. becaus if do that, then chang actual becom part regim chang toward authoritarianism.' sr: cite book someth i read high school: eugen ionesco' existenti play about fascism, rhinoceros, where peopl talk about their colleagu at work, academia, say stuff like, 'come on, i don't agre everything, but give him chance.' ionesco' point peopl join an unthink herd befor they know it. what would suggest peopl do, when they run into other who fall spectrum? ts: there few question here. one how keep yourself going. anoth how energ other peopl who agre you. third thing not quit rhinocero stuff, but how catch peopl who slipping. like cnn coverag last week speech congress, where one cnn comment said, 'oh, now presidential.' wa rhinocero moment, becaus there wa noth presidential--it wa atroci parad victim crime commit by one ethnicity. wa atroci there' noth presidenti about it. catch rhinocero moment one thing. i think it' realli import think about. exampl ionesco give peopl saying, 'yeah, one hand, jews, mayb they right.' trump, peopl will say someth like, 'yeah, but taxes, mayb he' right.' thing catch is, 'yeah, but favor regim change? favor end american way democraci fair play?' becaus that' what' realli at stake. peopl all way over at end spectrum who now confid about trump--that' differ subject. i think it' import maintain imposs human relat across divide, becaus some those peopl go chang their minds. it' harsh. but some will chang their minds, if they have no one talk to, will much harder them chang their minds. at differ point spectrum, have think differ ways. my own major concern right now self-confid energi peopl who do have deep--and, i think incorrect--convict someth ha gone wildli wrong. sr: peopl who have convict someth ha gone wildli wrong--that can describ trump support trump opponents. ts: that' good point. so much personal. book, i don't actual mention anybody' name, except thinker who i admire. so much person peopl think, 'well, if say anyth critical, about person, how don't like anyth about someon who like trump.' that' way there no polit discussion. i think it' useful, even though will never win argument, when talk about peopl who support administration, stay at level constitution. stay at level freedom, or stay at level basic issues, like, global warm realli go so great, when entir pentagon say nation secur threat?
