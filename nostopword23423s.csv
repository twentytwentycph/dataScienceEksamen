(remember: bureau's then-director, james comey, testified at march 20 house intelligence committee hearing investigation was probing possible coordination trump's campaign kremlin interference election.) retention default has been chalked up technological mishap. assuming truly was an indiscriminate, bureau-wide problem - lost texts not limited phones involved trump-russia investigation - hard imagine its going undetected five months an agency whose business information retention. but not inconceivable. attorney general jeff sessions maintains an aggressive inquiry underway, so let's assume (for argument's sake, at least) either texts will recovered or satisfactory explanation their non-retention will forthcoming. now, let's stick clinton-obama emails. only july 5, 2016, comey held press conference at which he delivered statement describing mrs. clinton's criminal conduct but nevertheless recommending against an indictment. we now know comey's remarks had been works two months were revised several times by director his advisers. past weekend, letter fbi regarding missing texts, senate homeland security committee chairman ron johnson (r., wis.) addressed some these revisions. according senator johnson, draft dated <date> (i.e., five days before comey delivered final version), contained passage expressly referring troublesome email exchange between clinton obama.

(that is, obama had emails from clinton, which he had know were from private account since her address did not end ""@state.gov"" state department emails do.) so how did obama his helpers ""clean up""? obama had his email communications clinton sealed. he did by invoking dubious presidential-records privilege. white house insisted matter had nothing do contents emails, course; rather, was intended vindicate principle confidentiality presidential communications close advisers. media content play along, had twofold benefit: obama was able (1) sidestep disclosure without acknowledging emails contained classified information (2) avoid using term ""executive privilege"" - all its dark watergate connotations - even though was precisely what he was invoking. note claims executive privilege must yield demands disclosure relevant evidence criminal prosecutions. but course, that's not problem if there will no prosecution. white house purported repair president's disingenuous statement cbs interview by rationalizing he had meant he learned clinton's homebrew server system through news reports - he hadn't meant claim unawareness she occasionally used private email. was sheer misdirection: from obama's standpoint, problem was he discussed government intelligence matters secretary state through private email account; fact that, addition, clinton's private email account was connected her own private server system, rather than some other private email service, was beside point. but, again, media was not interested such distinctions contentedly accepted white house's non-explanation. meanwhile, attorney general loretta lynch ordered comey use word ""matter"" rather than ""investigation"" describe fbi's probe clinton's email practices. ensured democratic administration's law-enforcement agencies were aligning their story democratic candidate's campaign rhetoric. if there was no investigation, there would no prosecution. april 2016, another nationally televised interview, obama made clear he did not want clinton indicted. his rationale was legally frivolous straw man: clinton had not intended harm national security. was not an element felony offenses she had committed; nor was dispute. no matter: obama's analysis was stated view chief executive. if, was sure happen, his subordinates executive law-enforcement agencies conformed their decisions his stated view, there would no prosecution. within few weeks, even though investigation was ostensibly still underway over dozen key witnesses - including clinton herself - had not yet been interviewed, fbi began drafting comey's remarks would close investigation. there would no prosecution. june 27, lynch met clinton's husband, former president bill clinton, an out-of-the-way arizona tarmac, where their security details arranged both their planes parked. over next few days, fbi took pains strike any reference obama's emails mrs. clinton from statement which comey would effectively end ""matter"" no prosecution. july 1, amid intense public criticism her meeting bill clinton, attorney general lynch piously announced she would accept whatever recommendation fbi director career prosecutors made about charging clinton. page told strzok text day, ""this purposeful leak following airplane snafu."" was also playacting. page elaborated attorney general already ""knows no charges will brought."" course she did: was understood by all involved there would no prosecution. knowing that, lynch had given fbi notice june 30 she'd announcing her intention accept comey's recommendation. fearing just might look bit choreographed, fbi promptly amended comey's planned remarks include assertion (which he fact made july 5): ""i have not coordinated or reviewed statement any way department justice or any other part government. they do not know what i am about say."" but they did not need participate drafting statement, they did not need know precise words he was going use. was not comey's decision anyway. all they needed know was there would no prosecution. july 2, decision she would not indicted long since made, mrs. clinton sat an interview fbi - something she'd never have done if there were chance she might charged. farce was complete justice department fbi permitting two subjects investigation - mills clinton aide heather samuelson - sit interview lawyers representing clinton. not something law enforcement abides when serious about making case. here, however, was clear: there would no prosecution. all cleaned up: no indictment, meaning no prosecution, meaning no disclosure clinton-obama emails. all worked like charm . . . except part where mrs. clinton wins presidency problem never spoken again. version piece also appeared national review online. <url> read more great articles here: <url>",<date>,<date>,<date>,clinton-obama emails: key understanding why hillary wasn't indicted - andrew mccarthy,john rolls,,[''],nan,nan,

42,7167,<url>,fake,<url>,"listen podcast audio: click here mike gleason: my privilege now welcome greg weldon, ceo president weldon financial. greg has over three decades market research trading experience, specializing metals commodity markets even authored book 2006 titled gold trading bootcamp, where he accurately predicted implosion u.s. credit market urged people buy gold when was only $550 an ounce. he highly sought-after presenter at financial conferences throughout country, regular guest financial shows throughout world, it's good have him back here money metals podcast. greg, thanks joining us today. it's nice talk again. how you? greg weldon: i'm great, thanks. my pleasure, micheal. mike gleason: well, when we had back mid-august were optimistic about gold at time. we had pretty good move higher, shortly thereafter ended up gold hitting one year high. but stalled out around $1,350 early september we're currently back below $1,300 we're talking here wednesday afternoon. gold hit resistance at about same level summer last year, so give us your update your current outlook. what drivers, if any, do see can push gold through $1,350 resistance level months ahead, greg? greg weldon: yeah, well, exactly said. had move we were anticipating when we last spoke kind had already started from 1205-ish level. all fitting into kind bigger picture, technical structure still leads bullish resolution. but accurately mentioned, got up what have been close to, not quite even towards last summer's highs around $1,375, $1,377. case, around $1,360 ran out steam. dollar kind changed some picture thought process linked fed changed some picture. so, embarked downside correction. $1,260 was low, have nice little correction from level. was level equated 200-day exponential moving average. it's level was just below 38% fibonnaci retracement move up from $1,205. actually, move up from $1,123 back at end 2016. so had real, critical support there. so, me, everything's kind mapped out way might expect to, structurally, market. from here, one two things happens, i think. well, one three things, anyway. could cut if have bit low rally backed up $1,300. back below little bit dollars; still looks kind strong. it's an interest rate differential dynamic more hawkish view fed priced into fed funds; gets transferred into two-year five-year treasury notes. two-year treasury notes at record high-yield relative german two-year schatzi. so, lifting dollar ... it's kind gravitational pull upside. some downside risk here; rally we just saw kind b-wave maybe have c-wave down towards $1,240. that's kind an ultimate low. whether or not plays out way, longer term we still like it. mike gleason: precious metals have had pretty respectable year all all. gold up about 11% year date. silver up about half much. there isn't exactly lot excitement. seems like it's always two steps forward, one step back. sentiment physical bullion markets, where we operate, muted. there multiple factors consider why metals markets stuck bit rut. seems us one big ones equities market stock prices just keep marching relentlessly higher. either investors have become totally desensitized risk or maybe there just isn't much risk well think there is. any event, barring some sort spike inflation expectations, which pushes metals stocks both higher, we don't see gold silver breaking out unless investors start getting nervous about stock market valuations thinking about safe havens. so what your thoughts about equity markets how they relate precious metals, greg? where do see stock prices headed near term? greg weldon: yeah, i mean it's perfect question because reality is, we our daily research we focused this, fact yesterday. we haven't spoken ... sounds like we arranged question. focusing fact gold, relative s&p, at low. really kind lows we've seen before, but at level where if get much lower, you're breaking down multi-year lows whole thing gets called into question from technical perspective. but my problem looking at from technical perspective, i think stock market living borrowed times. basically, fed has done exactly what they wanted do. they have flushed people out safe havens into risk assets. that's whole idea qe. worked. reflated stock market. has facilitated huge, unprecedented rise consumer credit. instead housing market being collateral like was 2006 2007, now it's stock market that's collateral, googles amazons world facebooks world. have demand being driven or really being fed by credit. now see credit numbers start slow. they're unsustainable. start see consumer roll over little bit. so that's number one risk stock market; it's actually consumer. if look at retail sales numbers, outside automobiles gasoline, which price-based, don't have much anything. have eating drinking growth slowing. that's key component, key layer discretionary spending that's an important tell bigger picture. consumer discretionary sector breaking down against s&p. so that's warning sign me. have, terms dynamics around what expectation gdp growth, predicated upon policies have not yet been even agreed upon, let alone voted upon, let alone implemented, let alone starting work. so, i worry about kind fracture between expectations, patience level stock investors, diminished returns, diminished volumes. i think there's stock market risk. that's one reasons we like gold, because what would go hand hand that, was some kind maybe statement or pull back dot plot from fed would then cause dollar come off its little rally here. mike gleason: let's play devil's advocate maybe little here. we look at these record stock prices wonder about what beyond extraordinarily high valuations past when pe ratios hit these levels, was signal markets were nearing top. but there's one big difference between past today: advent high frequency machine-driven trading. huge amounts daily volume generated by trading algorithms. game changer. these programs don't sense risk an emotional level like human traders do. they respond very differently geopolitical events. so, if today's markets seem disconnected from reality, perhaps because it's because they are. now have been front lines, trading these markets decades. were witness how markets have transformed recent years. what your take high frequency algorithmic trading what does say about possibility current equity market valuations can sustained or maybe even pushed higher? what your thoughts there, greg? greg weldon: that's phenomenal question it's very well timed given we did big special september called ""shrinkage,"" which shift fed policy here. but if take now your question, which pertinent now, look at experience, my experience over decades, brings back 1987 right off bat. we're not saying market's going crash. there clearly there lot differences. but when ask about high frequency trading, sounds me, first thing i think of, portfolio insurance steroids, times thousand, times ten thousand. so, risk terms just what catalyst then causes kind cascading downside? one things we've been pointing out our customers... by way, i'm working out gigantic special shows just how intriguing some similarities around movements dollar, movements bonds, movements gold, movements stocks, some ratios, even down crude oil, fed policy cpi. now there was basically from 1985 '87, once they kicked plaza accord, which depreciated dollar. lot intriguing connections there special report i'm writing this, it's called ""what, me worry?"" which we'd love make available any your listeners, first all, if they want email me. but terms catalyst, setting up, again i think landmines laying wait out there. i think if take an example, one things, like i said we've been telling our customers, if take amazon or google. stock trading at $1,000 share. need $1,000 buy one share. so, volume trading has diminished dramatically over last couple years stock prices has gone up. ownership huge. it's passive, it's managed investments, doesn't matter, doesn't discriminate terms what type investor. people who want own these stocks, own them. dynamic between price level being so high, nominally speaking, buy up block shares, amount money needed, pure simple, against volume, me, sets up something like you're talking about would exacerbated by flash crash. so, becomes very scary terms what kind meltdown could see if get ball rolling downside. i still think something will play out over some time. i think fed there. i don't think ... there lot differences. i'm not trying make direct '87 comparison. but i'll tell what, risk there. no doubt about it. risk rising. mike gleason: terms fed here, greg, what your thinking who might talks over janet yellen next fed chair then also, tell us what think they're going do here terms getting inflation where they want? basically, what your general thoughts fed fed monetary policy? clearly everyone's favorite subject. greg weldon: really, it's two totally separate questions right now because who donald trump going pick versus how inflation going play out. i think if look at what fed saying, fed has been very clear. where (jerome) powell becomes, what seems be, i'm not saying i believe this, i'm just saying seems powell's logical choice if, if, your goal maintain policy. thinking about bringing guy like (john) taylor, taylor rule where natural level fed funds should here, he would obviously much more hawkish choice. while him trump might have really gotten along, maybe there's lot trump can learn from him, i don't think that's guy trump wants terms policy trying get his growth agenda going. context, how maintain continuity, which really isn't bad. they're certainly not tight they're not tightening any nth degree. it's almost goldilocks material here, inflation aside. powell logical choice because make headline splash, which course he loves. basically make change, but kind keep status quo. other one would (kevin) warsh. he was more away from qe towards just using interest rates. he's an interesting kind dark horse. yellen certainly dark horse. what mattes really how does fed decide they're going deal inflation issue when they can't even decide what's causing it? because keep hearing transitory, idiosyncratic. these words being used repeatedly, over over over again describe, you've had one fed official go so far as, even yellen herself has made comments effect of, ""we don't understand why it's not materializing."" again, kind back taylor model, basic rule thumb fed counting on, i.e. hoping for, labor market continues tighten wages, inflation will go up will support general rise prices. question now becomes natural rate unemployment lower than we thought was. or, there structural differences now, technologically based dynamics labor market has hollowed out labor market, reason still have participation rate while finally up little, still so low historically, therein lies question. what kind keeping inflation back how does play out? i think employment numbers from month, september, were huge sense was biggest wage number ... know how i break number down. nth degree, was real deal. only one month, but still real deal, best wage number we've seen since 2007. so, will continue? we know anecdotal evidence there. will continue over next couple months? if look at cpi ppi, pipeline, year-over-year dynamics around some commodities, god forbid, grains, oil seeds, tropical commodities started rally because then you'd have real problem. look at what base models doing. look at what energy potentially you're going break out here. so, i think there some inflation coming it's apt push fed have raise meet their dot plots, i think that's going problematic equity markets. they're walking high wire act no safety net. it's very difficult job. mike gleason: getting back metals here bit. we would like give our listeners an update silver gold price rigging scandal erupted year half ago when deutsche bank was forced acknowledge cheating turned over mountains evidence, which may prove damning number other banks. but courts regulators have record moving slowly, if they do anything at all. now you're much closer futures markets than we are. aware any developments front what do see implications civil action against bullion banks? do sense deutsche bank revelations here led more honest markets, perhaps because all evidence struck fear into banker's hearts or more business usual these bullion banks who seem have so much influence these markets, greg? greg weldon: i have sense it's business usual. i get sense it's kind laissez faire attitude about because problem so big, if we were actually kind get unearthed, impact would much, much larger we would know based price section very quickly. it's powder keg. it'll blow at some point. something, gosh i've been business how long, we've been talking about how long? really, goes way, way back. degree which has gotten worse is, i mean, thing debate, not whether exists or not. going somehow uncovered extent causes kind disruption? i think again, probably fodder great movie... spy movie or whatever. sure, there's probably lot kind thing going background, but terms day day operation trading these metals, i don't see any tangible impact dealings i have here, no. mike gleason: well greg, we begin close, give us sense what you're focusing here, maybe some things we haven't touched then give us sense how you're evaluating these markets your clients. do think it's time get defensive, go cash, favor metals commodities here an inflation hedge, or does wave exuberance stocks still have ways go? any final comments or anything else want leave us today? greg weldon: well, i think some depends whether they can actually get some kind job done washington where republicans finally realize their own necks chopping block here, so let's finally ban together get tax reform package done. we'll see whether happens. i think might one those last gas type moves stock market. could ""buy rumor sell fact,"" but i think lot has been priced i think there's still going disappointment down road that. i'm watching consumer specifically. retail sales numbers have been really poor all year. it's minuscule gains discretionary items since january. debt numbers interesting. you're starting see roll over, starting see rise delinquency rates. debt obligations consumers federal government, by way, high despite fact rates still low. can imagine if feds actually did push rates hundred basis points higher over next however many, 14, 15 months? i think would have real reverberating effect consumer government where deficits still increasing they're at high levels again. no one talks about it. have $20 trillion dollars sovereign debt you're about push five-year note above 2%, which your trigger increase cost funding debt. man, land mines out there. i'm watching all it. that's what we do our clients every single day because never before, have had more plugged in. look at way things happen so much more quickly now. asked about what's difference from 30 years. so much more availability news, quickly. but fact matter is, basic thing we do hasn't changed at all, which dissecting all it, connecting all dots, kind trying make all make sense terms what markets doing how might profit from that. mike gleason: well greg, thank so much joining us again. we enjoyed very much love getting your very studied experienced outlook state today's financial world. now before we let go, please tell folks about weldon financial, how they can find you, any other information they should know about your firm. greg weldon: sure, thanks, appreciate that. we're found <url>. we do weldon live, one product, one price. it's kind multi-layered product, although it's just again, one price. we do daily we cover daily global macro, fixed income, foreign exchange, stock indexes etfs, precious industrial metals, energy, agricultural commodities. we tie them all together we have what we call our trade lab, which part weldon live. these specific trading recommendations all those sectors, we're old school futures guys, so that's kind way we approach it. what we find lot family offices or independent brokers or even individuals out there, there's no reason way your see etfs now being utilized average investor can't operate more like hedge fund manager or cta. we try provide rhyme reason what's going then specific strategies take advantage it. weldon live found at <url>. mike gleason: well great stuff. thanks so much your time today, greg. i hope we can talk again down road. take care we appreciate coming on. greg weldon: thanks. no problem, mike. any time. mike gleason: well, will do week. thanks again greg weldon weldon financial weldonlive. more information, simply go <url> we urge everyone sign up free trial there. again, can find all information at <url>. sure check out. mike gleason director money metals exchange, national precious metals dealer over 50,000 customers. gleason hard money advocate strong proponent personal liberty, limited government austrian school economics. graduate university florida, gleason has extensive experience management, sales logistics well precious metals investing. he also puts his longtime broadcasting background good use, hosting weekly precious metals podcast since 2011, program listened by tens thousands each week. <url>",<date>,<date>,<date>,debt-driven consumer economy breaking down: greg weldon,john rolls,,[''],nan,nan,
43,7242,<url>,conspiracy,<url>,"opinions vary topic, between those religion those without. they vary between politically motivated - those who believe morality based self-governance versus those who seek mans dominion over men through man-made, man-interpreted man-enforced laws. they even vary among believers, some whom believe an unwritten separation church state versus others who believe only which was actually written into our constitution by founders. if looking debate, few topics will so readily attract opposition. question faith or historical fact? it's hard get folks even agree that. then will have somehow separate fact from fiction, reporting these facts often more hysterical than historical. those who wish america godless society have developed plethora arguments support their agenda. but arguments not facts... we watch lawyers make arguments every day, seldom concerned any facts or even any sense real justice. but they can make an argument, sometimes very successful argument. if their argument not true, has justice been served? argument right if was made premise was all wrong, even though argument effective? america has always been one nation under god. though founders used generic terms like creator describe god, god they meant was their god, christian faith. atheists agnostics have long argued many founders were deists, using washington, jefferson, franklin, paine, hamilton, madison proof. however, each these cases, study their personal writings will debunk myth. how did america become one nation under god? dictionaries, terms ""deist,"" ""agnostic,"" ""atheist"" appear synonyms. basis, term deists would include those who believe there no god, those who believe distant, impersonal creator universe those who believe there no way know if god exists. brief study founders own writings prove beyond any reasonable doubt none notable founders fit description. thomas paine talked about ""the error schools"" teach sciences without ""reference being who author them: all principles science divine origin."" he stated ""the evil has resulted from error schools teaching [science without god] has been generating pupils species atheism."" benjamin franklin's 1749 plan education public schools pennsylvania insisted schools teach ""the necessity public religion . . . excellency christian religion above all others, ancient or modern."" franklin proposed biblical inscription seal united states; he chose new testament verse motto philadelphia hospital; he was one chief proponents paid chaplain congress; when franklin helped found college which bore his name 1787, was dedicated ""a nursery religion learning"" built ""on christ, corner-stone."" may 2, 1778, george washington charged his soldiers at valley forge ""to distinguished character patriot, should our highest glory add more distinguished character christian."" speech may 12, 1779, he claimed what children needed learn ""above all"" was ""religion jesus christ,"" learn would make them ""greater happier than they already are."" june 8, 1783, he reminded nation ""without humble imitation"" ""the divine author our blessed religion"" we ""can never hope happy nation"", he resigned his post commander-in-chief. washington's own adopted daughter declared washington might well question his patriotism question his christianity. hamilton began work rev. james bayard form christian constitutional society help spread over world two things which hamilton said made america great: (1) christianity (2) constitution formed under christianity. only hamilton's death two months later thwarted his plan starting missionary society promote christian government. thomas jefferson himself declared, ""i am real christian, say, disciple doctrines jesus."" president united states, jefferson signed treaty kaskaskia tribe wherein he provided--at government's expense--christian missionaries. james madison trained ministry rev. dr. john witherspoon, madison's writings replete declarations his faith god christ. his letter attorney general bradford, madison laments public officials not bold enough about their christian faith public public officials should ""fervent advocates cause christ."" madison did allude ""wall separation,"" but contemporary writers frequently omit madison's own definition ""wall"", which according madison, was only prevent congress from passing national law establish national religion. there have it... do any these men sound like deists you? not hard demonstrate america was indeed born one nation under god or god or creator they were referring was fact, jesus christ. alone should lay rest any honest debate over how america became nation built upon judeo-christian principles values. we can go on, founder after founder if want, but these men named by most who argue founders were at best, deists. why was america formed one nation under god? answer simple, yet vital importance every american, regardless their religious beliefs. answer begins these two words, ""self-governance"". patrick henry put way, ""it cannot emphasized too strongly or too often great nation was founded not by religionists but by christians, not religions but gospel jesus christ"". john adams said way, ""we recognize no sovereign but god, no king but jesus!

americans do not like congress. even relatively apolitical seem roused against them, many speaking out against recent bills congressional initiatives, phrases like, ""drain swamp!"" abounding social media. shouldn't more people lead better decisions? at least when comes government, answer would seem be: no. assumption seems if we could only get ""right"" people office, things would improve. however, would not seem problem people system, but an inherent flaw system itself. social psychology not discipline which tends address issues political organization. however, many current political issues, including recent wave hatred congress, can analyzed light social psychological principles, such classic theory groupthink. what groupthink? first studied by yale psychologist irving janis 1960s, groupthink refers tendency groups make bad or even disastrous decisions. groupthink was first studied by social psychologists after bay pigs when question was: how could president kennedy, cabinet experts, have made decision so flawed he himself would later call ""stupid?"" shouldn't more people lead better decisions? at least when comes government, answer would seem be: no. his 1972 book victims groupthink: psychological study foreign policy decisions fiascos, dr. janis identifies three risks groupthink's occurrence, which still taught psychology classrooms today: desire cohesiveness, structural faults, power situation. looking at how congress operates today, not hard see how inherently at risk groupthink understand slew bad/unpopular decisions which seem have become commonplace. three risks groupthink occurrence: congressmen like justin amash or senators like bernie sanders often touted ""rabble-rousers."" cohesion first risk groupthink an overwhelming desire cohesiveness. groups run risk groupthink when they value unity over making best/ethical decision. very often, when groups value unity too highly, they fall prey phenomenon deindividuation, foregoing individual beliefs principles favor those group. no longer matters what individual believes or wants such circumstances, it's matter yielding group influence. symptoms desire cohesion can include derogation dissenters, trying limit questioning group decisions, existence mindguards, individuals who ensure dissent kept minimum. it's not hard find examples these phenomena current political atmosphere. congressmen like justin amash or senators like bernie sanders often touted ""rabble-rousers"" who don't tow party line. idea often expressed principles should take backseat party unity party accomplishment, which so often takes form voting ""right way."" there also tests party ""purity,"" such democrats' recent ""pro-choice"" test, idea ""real"" democrat cannot pro-life. structural faults when congressmen like rand paul have filibustered opposition their party's agenda, leaders like john mccain attack them, implying they need fall line. second risk groupthink structural faults, specifically insulation closed leadership. by being insulated from outside voices or dissenting opinions, all while being subjected leadership which discourages dissent dictates ""how is,"" group likely doom itself making poor decision. congress seems inherently insulated when comes its decision-making. theory, congresspeople represent their constituency's interests at federal level. however, most congress-people not particularly touch their constituency. such insulation not congress's fault, but rather fault design; washington geographically isolated from most united states. getting touch one's congressperson can nigh impossible, especially if one far from washington. best-case scenario tends leaving messages congressional aides, but chances actual direct contact low. only exception seems campaign trail, goal which not governance, but re-election. senators, such insulation can doubly strong. passage 17th amendment, senators became essentially unaccountable any form local governance majority their term office. theory, direct election senators gives locals chance vote them out, but can hard remember senators' specific legislative actions when election season rolls around afterward, which can take several years. second structural fault which increases risk groupthink closed leadership: leaders who say ""this how is."" such leaders often play role mindguards: quashing dissent trying ensure congresspeople behave according party line rather than their own beliefs. again, it's not hard find instances recent politics. when congressmen like ted cruz or rand paul have filibustered opposition their own party's agenda, republican leaders like john mccain came out attack them as, essentially, traitors, implication being they need fall line, their own principles damned. power situation time pressures pose similar risk groupthink. third final risk groupthink power situation. very often, our behavior much function our circumstances our own individuality. two situational features increase likelihood groupthink: perceived threats time pressure. idea responding strongly quickly threat powerful, even evolutionarily advantageous. however, quick strong responses not often, if ever, best decisions. both parties often frame their agendas opposition an enemy, often opposite party. it's matter ""defeating"" other party via unanimous support, no room individual principles or beliefs. how 1000+ page-long legislation gets voted immediately, no chance discussion; action required, else ""they"" going win! time pressures pose similar risk groupthink. idea having get something - anything! - done before ""they"" can enact their sinister agenda seems define modern political rhetoric. we have pass healthcare/tax plans/net neutrality immediately! meanwhile, little chance elaboration or discussion these bills' merits given, shockingly, results rarely beneficial. until occurs, ""swamp"" going remain, no matter who inhabits what office. reducing groupthink's influence many strategies exist combating groupthink. however, two commonalities have emerged across most strategies: importance dissent providing time examine alternatives. current political climate, highly doubtful either these strategies feasible at federal level. congress, currently functions, rife partisan strife both socially geographically insulated, does not seem able resist groupthink. so what might solution? even at america's birth, our founders stressed danger centralized government gaining too much power ceasing truly represent their constituents. whatever solution found, utmost importance they kept touch those they represent partisan politics do not encourage legislation sake unity, but rather sake principle. until occurs, ""swamp"" going remain, no matter who inhabits what office. source: <url>",<date>,<date>,<date>,"""draining swamp"" doesn't matter long groupthink persists",freedom bunker,,[''],nan,nan,

will further inflame an already angry public."" so why public so ""inflamed"" ""antibanking sentiment?"" recent events here uk make easy see. 1. fool me 30 times, shame britons, at top list stands libor rate-fixing scandal, which uk's most prominent banks conspired fix baseline interest rate that's used calculate rates thousands financial products like mortgages. scandal continues unfold, giants citigroup chase still awaiting charges, among others. but common episodes where major banks have committed large-scale fraud, case involving hundreds billions dollars financial instruments, most heavily implicated bank, barclay's, not facing legal prosecution, merely large fine. new york times dealbook described settlement ""a multimillion dollar financial penalty modest admission wrongdoing, but no criminal conviction affect its operation."" pretty gentle treatment firm whose traders, while working manipulate key rate, said emails while executing collusion: ""always happy help;"" ""for you, anything;"" ""done...for big boy;"" from more conscientious employee, ""i will reluctantly, gradually, artificially get my libors line."" especially notable connection conspicuous absence bob diamond, disgraced ex-ceo barclay's, from london games, since diamond ""had been fixture years at uk events"" ""had been planning attend several olympic events guest...[but] after furor surrounding his resignation, he expected stay away."" banks politically smart enough keep their heads down when they look bad. course, libor affair pales its human impact when compared other recent banking scandals, like ""robo-signing"" scandal us. scam, thousands homes, mortgaged during housing bubbles, were foreclosed upon without required legal standing or paperwork. implicated banks, including four us megabanks--bank america, chase, citigroup wells fargo--settled charges justice department states $26 billion, an impressive figure. however, settlement does little real human families evicted fraudulently, including three-quarters million evictees who were foreclosed upon from finance crisis through end 2011, most whom received check $2000 each. 2. sanctions-busters fast-moving world banking scandals, standard chartered london impressively secured spot itself when was accused by new york regulator laundering quarter trillion dollars iranian money, violation us economic sanctions country. don't have support efforts us government economically strangle iran appreciate disregard law company emails cited criminal charge, including an executive confiding iranian

doubt add ""inflamed"" feelings general public. 3. one nation under fraud power financial sector such sec, whose job examine financial firms prevent or punish fraud, has become notorious avoiding punishing firms lying, even when dealing repeat offenders. while financial law allows serious penalties fraud, including large fines restrictions business practices, sec allows ""waivers"" these offenses has granted them quite liberally largest us banks. chase has settled six fraud cases since 2000, settlements run into hundreds millions dollars, but has argued before sec has ""a strong record compliance securities laws."" notably, sec justifies settling these cases issuing waivers by referring promises from firms not violate law future. yet when firms taken back court their next act fraud, their recidivism rarely brings stiffer penalty, any mere human would likely receive. fact, these waivers issued by regulator, nearly half go repeat offenders, ""wall street firms had settled previous fraud charges by agreeing never again violate very laws sec was now saying they had broken."" includes other industry giants like bank america also citigroup, which racked up so much fraud finally did get sanctioned. ability megabanks weasel out sanctions widespread fraud third reason industry's keen stay below radar. 4. high-speed glitches further undermining confidence our financial

iraq's oil history & outlook, part two iraq destined become regional if not global superpower based richness its oil wealth. after all, young democracy sits atop world's second-biggest reserves high-quality petroleum. iraq's future seems bright indeed. regardless current political squabbling, oil-fueled iraqi economy continues grow rapidly. it's perennially rated one world's top ten fastest-growing economies, there's plenty room additional expansion. still, order see clearest view what iraqi economy may look like five or ten years, it's helpful take look at history iraq's oil industry well new oilfield technologies increasing iraqi production revenues. part one, we looked at history iraq's oil-based economy well political economical developments leading up rise saddam hussein his control nation's economy. now let's take look at iraq's oil industry current economic outlook, particularly what they mean value iraqi dinar, beginning turning point coalition invasion 2003 which ousted saddam. beginning end saddam u.s.-led invasion occupation iraq quickly ended saddam hussein's ruthless 30-year regime, was also beginning new era iraq's long-neglected oil industry. saddam his cronies gone, nation soon entered period unprecedented economic growth fueled by its booming oil industry. once dust settled after 2003 invasion, american, european middle eastern oil companies quickly arrived, ready business. there was much work done. oil industry infrastructure kurdish region northern iraq was relatively unscathed by actual fighting during war. still, oilfield equipment facilities there suffered from years neglect due shortage replacement parts new technologies made unavailable by years un-imposed trade embargo economic sanctions. southern central iraq, scene was different: between gulf war 1991 fighting during 2003, approximately 60% oil production refinery facilities those regions were damaged. apart from impact economic sanctions war, saddam himself stunted country's oil industry even further by mandating reservoir-management policies which resulted lower production several years after his departure. wells were over-pumped, which some cases permanently reduced their future outflows. and, an attempt boost yields lagging because equipment maintenance issues, iraqi engineers reinjected excessive amounts low-end petroleum fractions back into ground. reinjection standard industry technique increasing well's output. however, iraqi petroleum engineers reinjected overly-viscous oil constituents back into some wells, which slowed output several years after saddam's departure. huge reserves compensate missteps regardless mismanagement under saddam, fact iraq's overall oil production has soared since his departure illustrates enormity iraq's reserves resiliency its industry. spite thirty years bungling, iraq has been steadily achieving higher oil production totals almost every year since saddam's demise. according conservative estimates dating 2001, iraq believed have at least 145 billion barrels oil remaining tapped, several more-recent estimates have nearly doubled figure. geographically, most iraq's known petroleum reserves lie belt runs roughly north south along eastern side country. iraq has at least 10 fields known ""super giants"" (minimum 5 billion barrels each) another 25+ ""giant"" fields (minimum 1 billion barrels each). leading petroleum engineers have indicated southeastern iraq's cluster super-giant fields world's largest concentration such fields, accounting about 80% country's reserves. remaining 20% known reserves found northern region kirkuk, khanaqin mosul. and, there seems plenty room more oil discoveries - iraq unique because only tiny fraction its known reserves under development, even though already exports enormous amounts crude oil. development continues, more oil gushes forth. fact, since 1925 only about 2,200 wells have been drilled throughout iraq. comparison, approximately one million wells have already been drilled state texas alone. iraq also ""full gas."" country's proven reserves natural gas approximately 115 trillion cubic feet, which fifth-largest world. about two-thirds these known gas reserves located southern iraq, rest north. back work any event, soon saddam was gone iraqi oil industry began returning normal. during years between 2003 2008, iraq was busily repairing both its civilian infrastructure damaged by war well upgrading its long-neglected oilfields. 2008 iraqi government announced new plan work world's largest oil companies - shell, exxonmobil, bp total, who were original partners iraq petroleum company (ipc) dating back 1929. plan was quickly replaced by an even larger, more comprehensive plan develop iraq's oilfields. 2009 iraqi ministry oil formally awarded service contracts these original ""big oil"" companies well several other international firms including chevron. oilfields under contract development include iraq's ""super-giant"" fields: halfaya, majnoon, west qurna, rumaila. china national petroleum corporation (cnpc) bp won contract develop rumaila field, which iraq's largest single field. result these agreements iraq was able increase its production dramatically. by 2009 iraq had risen from near-zero production at end saddam's reign become world's twelfth-largest producer. 2010 u.s. government allocated $2 billion help develop modernize iraqi oil gas industry, although its direct involvement managing industry ended 2008. by end 2012 iraqi oil production had risen nearly 3.5 million barrels per day. then, 2014 another milestone was reached: production averaged 3.6 million barrels per day, level not achieved since 1979. 2014 brief glitch arose when kurdistan regional government (krg) seized control several northern oilfields dispute central government baghdad regarding revenues. fortunately, early 2015 was at least temporarily resolved, oil flows have returned normal since then. newer technologies boost iraqi output 2015, iraqi oil production already benefiting from new technologies which had been unavailable during years un trade embargo. during past few years these newer technologies have been introduced into iraq by international oil companies have been using such methods increase oilfield yields other countries. given iraq's huge reserves, nation's oil industry will certainly gain maximum benefit from these technologies. most important new technologies directional drilling hydraulic fracturing, both which promise help boost iraqi production exports significantly. directional drilling before 1970s, most wells were drilled vertically. is, hole was drilled straight downward until reached oil, or not. then, 1973 several drilling companies developed techniques slant drilling, which was an early form directional drilling allowed hole drilled at slight angle. directional drilling equipment allows drill bit move curving line rather than straight line, so can snake its way around underground obstacles such unusually hard rock formations. fact, given enough depth, wells can drilled horizontally, is, parallel surface land above. first practical benefit directional drilling allows drillers reach oil reservoirs several miles away from site drilling rig. current technology allows drillers drill far 6 miles away laterally. so, example, directional drilling allows land-based rigs drill offshore locations, which significantly reduces production expenses. and, oil located under steep mountains can likewise tapped from nearby flatlands. most importantly iraq, directional drilling allows producers increase length underground pipe exposed reservoir. instead simply having very end pipe inserted into an oil reservoir, directional drilling fairly long perforated section pipe placed contact oil. critically important ensuring high flows once well completed, since oil can sucked through much larger surface area. iraq directional drilling enables producers overcome sluggish flows which had resulted from saddam's policy over-drawing oil from wells then reinjecting thick, undesirable residues back into ground hopes obtaining short-term increases flow, mentioned above. and, directional drilling also makes possible multiple wellheads draw oil from single drilling site, so extended length perforated pipe exposed oil reservoir means greater yields. likewise, directional drilling also allows single wellhead draw oil and/or gas from within several different geologic strata (layers rock) at different depths, something which impossible older perpendicular drilling methods. introduction directional drilling technologies has helped iraq dramatically increase its production, these technologies hold promise even greater yields future. hydraulic fracturing hydraulic fracturing, sometimes also called fracking, method stimulating wells produce more oil. effectiveness fracking was discovered during series experiments 1947, first commercial application came 1950. although some communities u.s. have debated use fracking our domestic production, iraq practice potential godsend because may allow oil producers significantly increase their wells' outputs. water containing suspension sand other constituents injected under high pressure down into well order create cracks oil-bearing rock. these cracks allow oil flow more freely within underground reservoir, therefore more can extracted. hydraulic fracture created underground by pumping fracturing fluid into wellbore order increase underground pressure enough crack rock. rock cracks, fracturing fluid continues onward, extending cracking further further. fracking equipment can operate at pressures flow rates up 15,000 pounds pressure per square inch (psi) inbound flows fracking fluid high 100 barrels per minute. sand other materials called proppants added fracking fluid order ""prop open"" cracks already created, so they won't close while oil flowing outward. these propped-open fractures allow oil gas trapped within rock more easily flow outward. it's been estimated fracking increases oil production by an average about 17%, natural gas production by an average 45%. most importantly, when used together fracking directional drilling have synergistic effect - yields both together may substantially higher than if each were used separately. outlook given its huge oil reserves long-term commitments by international oil companies develop its oil gas fields, iraq certain have bright economic future. measured by its ever-increasing volume oil exports, country's oil industry has fully recovered from damage mismanagement suffered during saddam hussein's reign. notwithstanding iraq's already-known reserves, seems likely recent new exploration efforts by oil companies will lead an even greater tally iraq's oil wealth. it's also important note iraq isn't just blessed large reserves, also happens geologic formations holding iraq's oil much more accessible drilling than they most countries, which means costs extracting oil much lower. significant because iraq can profitably produce petroleum at prices less than $40 per barrel. contrast, u.s. shale oil costs between $90 $100 per barrel produce, even most cost-effective wells texas generally require global oil price at least $40 per barrel order profitable. so, iraq can afford pump sell oil at prices below those most other producing nations. these production advantages have been visible during recent saudi arabian oil-production war designed bankrupt u.s. shale-oil producers. while oil producers u.s. elsewhere have been severely impacted by saudis' overproduction, iraq continues produce profitably. oil drives iraqi dinar given world's insatiable appetite oil gas, iraq's dominant supply role likely become even stronger going forward. although it's difficult predict future certainty, seems likely sometime near future iraq will grow into regional international energy super-power based its rich reserves. fact, iraq seems on-track replace saudi arabia region's wealthiest, most-developed nation within next few years. what does mean dinar? nation's economy, well value its currency, depends its natural resources. iraq's exceptionally large oil reserves like ""money bank,"" available meet young democracy's needs continues grow. eventually value iraqi dinar should rise reflect true value country's oil wealth. seems likeliest occur once central bank iraq (cbi) frees dinar from artificially-low value placed 2003 following darkest days saddam hussein's regime. when occurs, strength iraq's economy will rapidly become obvious all observers worldwide, not simply those few individuals who have taken time research it. any

russia generating backlash would lead two countries replication or continuation 45-year cold war reagan gorbachev then first president bush said they had ended 1989-1990 has unfolded more or less worst ways i worried about. i don't think anybody would deny they we're new cold war. i think they're slow acknowledging it's even more dangerous various ways reasons than was 45-year cold war. but one reason was not case during old cold war we militarily eyeball-to-eyeball russia three new cold war fronts. one, course, ukraine which way epicenter but because nato's i think reckless military buildup russia's western borders particularly baltic regions region but also certain extent syria where situation very fluid still dangerous. cold war could erupt into an actual hot war very easily. i guess though danger seemed maybe year ago would first foremost syria because ukraine since 1914 seemed rather frozen. now it's shifted back ukraine. we've got stop think what means. ukraine nation then state following end soviet union 1991 was always fraught historical religious, ethnic, economic, political divisions. simply holding ukraine together unitary state was going problem but everyone managed. wasn't pretty but they managed until events 2014 when we all remember maidan protest let's remember what they were about...the legally-constitutionally elected president ukraine, viktor yanukovych, declined sign so-called european union partnership agreement. was just said civilizational economic was said would bring ukraine into european civilization course away from russia. now ukraine russia had been bound at hip. people don't mention often but there tens millions intermarriages. it's hard not go moscow spend some time not find someone who's got ukrainian russian parent or grandparent. but happened also needs removed reminded yanukovych did not refuse sign agreement. he simply asked more time. but set off protests driven by all sorts people. some benign democratic seeking liberals, fine people ukraine, but also by people who were by any definition ultra-nationalists even quasi-fascist neo-nazis. led course confrontation where yanukovych was driven illegally off. new, illegal government was formed backed by united states europe. russia various reasons i think were legitimate feared unrest would spread historical russian peninsula crimea which most its history centuries had been part russia. but because kind fluke, was now territorially part ukraine. russians therefore welcomed encouraged referendum crimea. by all standards including gallup polls were taken later, more than 80 percent voted join russia. so russia legally annexed 2014...they don't call annex, they call reunited crimea. meanwhile, mostly russian provinces donbass, part crimea objected coup kiev had overthrown president. they had voted yanukovych. his electorate was not only southeastern ukraine but was primarily there. so they believed their president had been overthrown rebellion began backed by russia course. war has gone now nearly four years. official number dead 10,000 but it's surely many more perhaps 2 million people who lived southeastern ukraine have been displaced most them gone russia. incidentally, russia gets no credit very humanitarian way they have handled all these people, refugees who fled russia. now course was easier because they were russian speakers. but great many them have rebuilt their lives. vocationally terms their family russia. whether they'll ever go back ukraine not clear. so that's where situation was kind frozen. there was agreement know called minsk 2 agreement all european powers agreed there. president ukraine, poroshenko, agreed putin agreed too resolution crisis. called two things...a cessation along designated line fighting kiev's agreement donbass would given home rule. remain within what would essentially federated ukrainian state. no one has ever suggested better or alternative solution that. during years since minsk was formalized 2015, by all evidence seems both sides have violated agreement. but kiev has refused grant any home rule rebel provinces we know from history whether it's from irish civil war or other diverse countries only way save state make federation. but opposition ukraine among ultra-right enormous. president poroshenko weak both person leader terms his public support at home. united states has done nothing encourage real implication minsk. so remains hot front. one could imagine all sorts bad outcomes because it's now proxy war donbass rebels were backed by russia. kiev backed by united states proxy war could become direct war. final point has been long winded but when ever since obama was trying figure out what do about ukraine. idea united states sending more higher quality weapons kiev. presumably suppress rebellion donbass though formally said ward off new russian attack which there no evidence or intention. obama refused do (send heavy weapons). he was under enormous pressure especially from liberal wing democratic party which has become very hawkish he refused do that. seemed clear from donald trump's campaign he would never do because he wanted cooperate russia. yet he has been compelled i think agree send weapons kiev when what they'll send isn't yet clear but he can only make matters worse really matters worse. that's where we today. discussion then turns present day. narrative west russia seized crimea some sort post-soviet expansion, where putin must stopped he desperately trying recreate borders old soviet union. at tfmr, we have always felt was bogus failed acknowledge any context from russian point view. professor cohen resumes: situation from russian point view was even worse. i mean crimea...and understand have know russian history, know russians know crimea...crimea historically, culturally was such part russia so many centuries right through soviet period would be....this bit stretch if say texas because once

russian culture russian sentiment. wasn't just naval base at sebastopol which was vitally important, although russians which had been leasing naval base by way what happened at maidan called into question whether kiev would honor long term lease any longer. you're absolutely right about that. russia was building far north an alternative naval base. i mean technically could have replicated crimea strategically could have done but could never have replicated crimea hearts minds russians. and, poll after poll referendum showed hearts minds some 80 percent crimean people. now crimea also has tartar crimeans ukrainians who don't share view. but overwhelming majority crimeans who were born there or moved there or lived there decades, was their sentiment. now here's political background. nonetheless all years i've followed post soviet russia, beginning 1991, i never saw any kremlin leadership give any indication was going take crimea back. let me repeat that. could not find, certainly not public record...who knows what...dreams...you know these kinds people have pentagon elsewhere secretly dark night. but neither yeltsin nor putin ever gave any public support idea which could find moscow some intellectual circles know, crimea ours. fact, at one point they needed draw new maps because crimea was now no longer russia after 1991. putin wrote president crimea...i don't recall which one was saying ""hey our map people want get new maps could get your map people work them because there's number borders aren't clear we've got clarify them"". he got no response. other words, notion crimea might taken or even negotiated back into russia simply was not political agenda kremlin under putin until 2014. final segment discussion deals future . + more specifically, what if anything can done by i...regular everyday people...to effect change divert war party from path destruction? professor cohen had some thoughts there, too. i'm not trump supporter i didn't vote him. however, we can actually support donald trump's campaign promise which i think he's tried act since he's been president it's necessary cooperate russia. what was called detente 20th century. i don't know why trump doesn't make point. i don't think he has very good advisors regard russia either terms what's going russia or terms his own policy making but trump might say his own defense because they're indicting him simply saying i want cooperate russia putin particular. he could say look, every republican president consequence 20th century pursued detente russia. first eisenhower, first detente spirit camp david khrushchev, then nixon kissinger attempt at grand detente brezhnev finally above all ronald reagan detente gorbachev last soviet leader soviet russian leader so great reagan gorbachev ended cold war. trump could put himself tradition say ""i'm traditional republican. what eisenhower, nixon reagan did. they did wisely. they avoided nuclear war russia. we're new cold war. dangers grave. it's not only my duty american president pursue cooperation ward off catastrophe but i commend honorable tradition republican party"". he doesn't say that. i don't know why i say because he doesn't know what or because he wants one only i have no idea what he needs say. if he said would compel conversation washington we're not having. what's happened detente what's happened we have if we ignore his own idiom put again i speak story historical language 20th century diplomacy. we have pro-detente president who first time history not permitted at least try because every time he has sensible conversation putin, no matter whether it's face face or telephone, he's accused not only by traditionally crazies american politics but by new york times treason. so what we could do will hard lot people because loathing trump. so pervasive just i didn't vote trump fifth amendment i didn't vote trump i didn't support president trump. but about he not only right. he's our only hope at moment. so one possibility simply say no matter all else we support donald trump's attempt cooperate russia because it's existential. now would enough us do would few newspapers do that? would few these cable tv panelists? would they ever have panelist who would do that? we might affect little civic courage congress where few people there would do so also. but at moment have complete blackout perspective

""you mean how could i have voted george w. bush--as opposed hypocritical scold like al gore, or self-aggrandizing blowhard like john kerry?"" i invariably respond. unless you've has been living an alternative universe, you're well aware avalanche criticism directed at donald trump from all quarters, liberal conservative, including latest hypocritical screed by mitt romney. yet despite criticism, virtually everyone engaged ignores essential reality attends every election: context everything. other words, whatever one feels about donald trump, or any other candidate matter, ultimate question answer cannot postponed indefinitely, donald trump--running against whom? unfortunately, john kerry remained true his appetite power, thus american public remains afflicted secretary state who needs ""additional evaluation"" undertaken before he can decide if wholesale systematic slaughter christians middle east constitutes ""genocide."" man who, when informed former gitmo detainee had returned terrorism, epitomized utter clueless entire obama administration's foreign policy. ""he's not supposed doing that,"" kerry stated. being said, there little doubt my mind commander-in-chief al gore or john kerry would have been worse leaders by several orders magnitude. gore had decency take his global warming hustle into private sector, where he made millions selling christian-like dispensations known ""carbon credits"" terminally gullible. unfortunately like his father, george w. believed maintaining comity his democrat detractors was apparently more important defending most momentous decision any commander-in-chief must make. reneging his no new taxes pledge accommodate democrats--who savaged him return--probably cost george h.w. bush 1992 election. george w.'s flaccid response reid company gave us democratically-controlled congress 2006--and paved way rise barack obama 2008. let's clear here. neither ringing endorsement what bush accomplished, nor knock what i perceived his major failings, foremost which was allowing democrats co-opt iraq war narrative without any substantive pushback. when american men women harm's way, allowing slanderous hack like harry reid declare war ""lost"" even before ultimately successful surge was completed, was an unconscionable unnecessary surrender. pretty clear eight years obama administration's effort ""fundamentally transform united states america"" into socialist utopian paradise, third world underpinning millions illegals represent, has enraged millions americans. maybe even point, so many trump's critics point out, where anger frustration has completely supplanted anything resembling rational thinking. anger frustration about what? how about gop establishment has made an utter mockery their base's support now process going after base's preferred candidate kind vigor viciousness they have never directed at at barack obama or hillary clinton? moreover, what world do they think would happen if they purposely orchestrate brokered convention where none current presidential candidates get nomination? they have know number conservatives who stayed home when milquetoast mitt ""polited"" his way defeat would dwarfed by number who would stay home if an establishment gop candidate were force-fed base. thus an inescapable conclusion arises: establishment gop would tolerate president hillary clinton maintain their control party--even if they run party into dustbin history result. would same hillary clinton, who believes rule law applies everyone else but her her husband. same hillary clinton who left four americans die benghazi then lied about video being cause their demise when her own communications her daughter, egyptian prime minister hisham kandil libyan president night attack indicated she knew otherwise. women who still can't explain at very least how highly-classified emails ""migrated"" from wholly secure self-contained government servers her personal one. woman no discernible accomplishments senator, track record colossal failure secretary state. woman who successfully used sexist card bash every republican, until trump came along threw right back her predator-enabling face. make no mistake: not an endorsement donald trump. i'm not big fan palookaville style politics, or mud-wrestling into which republican primary season has devolved. but if trump does make finish line, hillary his opponent, then what? if comes down these two, who do want picking next supreme court justice--or three? who do want formulating immigration policy? who has better vision our terminally-underperforming economy? who do want defending america against islamist terror, iranian nuclear ambitions russian chinese military expansionism? who do want restoring american exceptionalism, someone who might believe it, or someone who clearly doesn't? electorate has long been forced choose between ""lesser two evils,"" there little doubt may very well prove most pernicious choice modern history. but remains choice nonetheless, maybe most important one very long time. thus behooves every would-be voter keep context mind, no matter how down dirty 2016 presidential campaign becomes. fact, context all ultimately matters.",<date>,<date>,<date>,context everything,"arnold ahlert, because without america, there no free world.",,"['conservative news', 'conservative newspaper']","news, politics, editorials, commentary, canada free press, because without america, there no free world",nan,

i don't know. markets meant ""climb wall worry"", regular corrections. seemingly unstoppable move upwards could precursor violent correction, possibly? successful trader mark minervini recently tweeted only times he can remember american market being exuberant, were just before 1987 crash, just before <url> bubble bursting 2000. however, big rise could justified? maybe us shares re-rating because big corporate tax cuts us will increase earnings considerably? turn could trigger an economic boom, increased investment amp; virtuous circle higher growth, greater consumer spending, etc. who knows? that's what happened under president reagan, after all - he initially stimulated us economy big tax cuts, which ushered period great economic success. these things impossible predict, nearly all forecasters get so wrong would have expected them pack forecasting bad job. yet strangely, people (especially media) still treat their forecasts quite unjustified reverence. economics still very much its infancy, has barely scratched surface, terms being able accurately predict what economy will do practice. so i think it's best accept we haven't got clue what future holds. despite this, i'm increasingly nervous about market melt-up, so have opened some short positions us markets. that's proving expensive so far, but i don't mind losses hedges. they're an insurance policy, insurance costs money. regards uk markets, i'm seeing lot nervousness small mid caps at moment. feels like days everything going up, day after day, now over. we've been spoiled by very buoyant market conditions, long time now. there many former momentum stars, which have sold off considerably last few months (e.g. boohoo.com (lon:boo) (i'm long) iqe (lon:iqe) . investors seem ignoring many satisfactory, or even good updates, banking profits instead. there certainly seems lack investor appetite take small caps new highs at moment. that's probably quite sensible actually, lots small caps now very pricey, uk economy seems soft patch, so there seem lots profit warnings being issued. mind you, bargains can found illiquid markets, when some investors start throwing out baby bath water, and/or see their stop losses triggered no particular underlying reason. i favour such market conditions, from time time market throws bargain my direction, people sometimes act irrationally - scared out good shares by erratic spikes down price. anyway, let's have look at some small cap announcements today. by way, i apologise any typos today - am using small laptop, screen i'm struggling see properly.

[note 7] he got his money! goldmann may have interpreted willingness german chancellor pay half billion dollars proof claim all synagogues had been destroyed. why else would germany so foolish pay something which never happened? all same, ""historical truth"" ""all"" german synagogues were destroyed lie. 1938 there were approximately 1,400 synagogues germany, which only about 180 were destroyed or damaged. furthermore, jews owned approximately 100,000 shops department stores germany 1938. number, only about 7,500 had their windows broken. these figures show just how much so-called ""historical truth"" differs from what actually happened. damage destruction did actually occur was, course, terrible shame, but exaggerations, especially by german historians who use them condemn their own people, also shame. history writers tell us during crystal night all jews were frightened, meekly accepted whatever happened them watched destruction their property no resistance. contrary true. while going through files subject, i found many documents which report precisely just opposite what claimed. fact many cases jews their german neighbors fought together against attackers, pushing them down staircases. street mobs were beaten up chased away more than one case. police party officials were generally side jews. some jewish community leaders went police stations next morning asked police investigate damage done their synagogues. resulting police reports still available files today. also contrary what we have been told, most jews were not directly affected by these events. berlin, example, all teachers pupils city's largest jewish school, which served entire berlin area, appeared their classes next morning without having noticed anything unusual during previous night. heinemann stern, jewish principal school, wrote his postwar memoirs he noticed burning synagogue his way school morning after crystal night, but he thought was just an accidental fire. was only after he arrived at school he received telephone call informing him destruction previous night. he then went his classes day only during first recess did he take trouble inform entire student body about what had happened.

questioner: big one i even have substance-abuse problem. i feel so shameful about it, like i'm wrong bad. it's substance abuse prescription medications got out hand now i'm working it. i feel so much shame i've spent last ten years my life substance-abuse problem. mary magdalene: what were these medications originally prescribed for? questioner: was attention deficit disorder. i'm really sensitive helped me kind shut off my feelings so i could focus do work. sometimes i think i'm not cut out world: i'm too sensitive, too emotional. i can't like if i need work do practical things life. so that's what was prescribed for. but i'm at point now where i don't want take medication any more. i want love respect my body. mary magdalene: so simply you're wanting get off medication that's been prescribed? or have taken medication ways wasn't prescribed. questioner: both. i've taken ways weren't prescribed i'm working therapist get off it. it's only past two months i've been able acknowledge been honest about it. so i'd like any guidance about getting off it, but also help shame i feel around it. there's another shame, too, started when i was really young. was first shame, which i'm just starting realize. when i was really young, like still diapers, i masturbated. growing up catholic household, i knew was so shameful. i still feel so much shame around now. i was so young; i don't know why i did it. mary magdalene: thank speaking this. when one has shame, even speaking difficult because there so much fear about being ostracized, being abandoned if show people part yourself feel shame for. so speaking about beginning healing. shows that, first, you've become aware honest yourself what's going on, have these areas have shame about. then begin find people who can trust, who it's safe share open up part yourself them. that, itself, great step healing. need have discernment speaking others about this. important only open yourself up people who discern safe. there people who may not safe open up to, people who may not understand or hold these events same way do. not necessary or even wise open up those people. can choice about who people who safe open up to, people who will supportive open up to, who actually will help ways wanting help. so very aware your choice start empower yourself choice rather than being at effect random responses from random individuals. how does part feel you? questioner: feels good. gives me lot security guidance. mary magdalene: yes. beginning reclaiming your own personal power. when there's shame, have given away part your power someone or some entity probably trusted. now, at stage life you're currently in, may realize they weren't entirely trustable or they weren't entirely your highest good. they gave messages what were doing was bad, wrong, sinful, evil, or somehow you, yourself, were bad, wrong, sinful, evil, or deficient, not right, not good enough because were engaging certain behaviors. very sad state affairs. very third-dimensional issue because third-dimensional consciousness there very strong belief these dualities good-bad, right-wrong, evil-godly, those kinds things. at higher dimensions, we see things very differently. we see those kinds dualities quite destructive, quite harmful people's spiritual growth their spiritual path. part spiritual process at third dimension realizing many people have been programmed kind thinking certain things good certain things bad; certain things godly certain things ungodly; kind thing. those beliefs not given. choice hold such beliefs. i would like suggest very different possibility, which from my point view part transcendence third dimension moving into higher-dimensional consciousness. possibility see there no such thing good-bad. there no such thing right-wrong. all there experiences either supporting or not supporting your divine growth unfoldment. when were very young were touching yourself or experiencing your sexual energy through forms touch self-pleasuring whatever way did, certainly was not bad or wrong any way at all, from my point view. i see completely natural thing do because were becoming aware your physical body your energy--including your sexual energy, which connected your physical body. were exploring that. me healthy learning how walk, where you're exploring your physical body its possibilities mobility. no one said were bad or wrong or evil exploring movement walking. i certainly don't see any more bad, wrong, or evil learning about exploring your sexual energy your physical sexuality. i see most unfortunate institutions, such catholic church, have promoted belief bad, wrong, sinful, or whatever else doing what i consider not only very natural thing but healthy thing. sexuality part who we are. it's no more evil than your appetite food. people don't call being hungry having meal evil. hunger simply an energy have your body that's connected physical systems natural your body. same true sexuality. however, sexuality has potential connecting god very profound way, way most people much more profound than most your other bodily functions. fact, why religious institutions have tried convince people sexuality bad, wrong, or whatever. if did not have belief, if believed or understood your sexuality natural, healthy, important, vital part your life connection god, would naturally empowered person--empowered transcend limitations third dimension third-dimensional thinking. those institutions have not wanted people become empowered way, because they benefited from people's separation from their own power, people's obedience them placing them position power. all part third-dimensional legacy. it's all part what beings learning about learning transcend grow beyond their experience coming earth. not only part your spiritual path explore your sexuality, but part your spiritual path go beyond limitations thinking says your sexuality shameful or sinful any way, go beyond being limited by kind belief structure. so from my point view, many ways right course. you're having your experience having been limited by having taken these belief systems, which was probably very natural, understandable thing do because encountered them child. very likely, ones who were trusting discern which beliefs were supportive take believed this. so took because they believed it. but now an adult. growing maturing spiritually. your time become aware conscious what choose believe, what choose follow, what ideas choose empower things seem true, sense they consistent your own experience your own guidance. i am guessing from what you've said no longer ascribe beliefs sexuality or even masturbation inherently wrong or bad or sinful, yet struggling earlier programming. right? questioner: correct. mary magdalene: even kind conversation can immensely helpful understanding just one option amongst many, many options. from my point view, were probably sensitive child. your awareness energy was probably very high. so were naturally aware your sexual energy at young age, possibly younger than many other people. were empowering yourself explore this. these all very wonderful things, from my point view. there certainly no harm, i am aware of, can come child from exploring their sexuality, masturbating, having orgasms. but because their programming, other individuals--very likely including your family members--may have been uncomfortable this. may have been conflict their beliefs, or level shame they carried, or their comfort around sexuality altogether, because programming they received ascribed to. fact, problem was probably much more part those who told were wrong. maybe they didn't even tell that. maybe they just were experiencing within themselves. because very sensitive being, picked up their discomfort, their conflict, their beliefs. took on. does seem accurate? questioner: that's exactly how seems. mary magdalene: so first part realize these were really their issues, their difficulty, their challenges took on, not your own. were simply being your own natural, sensitive self. what's important realize decision yours take their issues your own issues was your choice. course were very young natural do things like when young. but nevertheless was choice. now have choice no longer continue take those beliefs or those conflicts others carrying. can sense yourself? questioner: yes, absolutely. mary magdalene: again, does not mean need go telling everyone meet feel differently or have different point view. may not supportive. choice about who share with. but can certainly do yourself relationship these arenas. can do relative sexuality. can also do relative your use medicine were taking. i have been shown very strongly whenever being makes choice, there always very wonderful, or could say beautiful, reasons choice. those reasons what i have called your ""inner divine qualities."" when made choice first take medicine, then later take more than was being prescribed, had very important reasons why made choice. doesn't mean outcome choice--the outcome behaviors chose engage--are ones pleased about. could look at outcome those behaviors regret choice. regret chose act upon your motivations particular way. but regret shame very different things. regret part human experience. humans makes choices. retrospect, some choices happy about some choices not happy about. both serve your growth. so fine make choices not happy about. part growth process. when realize you've made choices you're not happy about, most humans experience regret. but if have been given program whenever feel regret means you're bad person, then very likely regret will turn into shame. shame saying ""there's something defective about me because i made choice, or i took action."" based combination regret judgment. you're making judgments about yourself, such as: ""i should have known better."" ""i should have been stronger."" ""i shouldn't have been vulnerable kind artificial support."" making those kinds judgments about yourself? questioner: yes. mary magdalene: there other judgments you're making, too? questioner: tends same things: ""i shouldn't have done that."" ""i should stronger."" ""i shouldn't so emotional."" ... mary magdalene: ""i should know better."" ""i should more stable.""

168,26536,alternet.org,political,<url>,"if we don't act now, fascism will our doorstep, says yale historian photo credit: <url> how close president donald trump following path blazed by last century's tyrants? could american democracy replaced totalitarian rule? there's enough resemblance yale historian timothy snyder, who studies fascist communist regime change totalitarian rule, has written book warning about threat offering lessons resistance survival. author tyranny: twenty lessons from twentieth century talked alternet's steven rosenfeld. steven rosenfeld: three weeks ago, said country has perhaps year 'to defend american democracy.' said what happens next few weeks crucial. more concerned than ever our political culture institutions evolving toward fascism, resembling key aspects early 20th-century european regimes you've studied? timothy snyder: let me answer three parts. first thing 20 lessons i wrote, i wrote november 15th. book, tyranny, was done by christmas. which means if people read now, people reading it, it's describing world they in, means i've successfully made predictions based history. we're going talk about what going come, but i want point out timeline--it was basically completely blind. but book does describe what going now. year figure there because we have recognize things move fast. nazi germany took about year. hungary took about two half years. poland got rid top-level judiciary within year. it's rough historical guess, but point because there an outside limit, therefore have act now. have get started early. it's just very practical advice. it's meta-advice past: things slip out reach you, psychologically very quickly, then legally almost quickly. it's hard people act when they feel other people won't act. it's hard people act when they feel like they have break law do so. so important get out front before people face those psychological legal barriers. am i more worried now? i realize was your question. no, i'm exactly worried i was before, november. i think people who inhabit white house inhabit different ideological world which they would like united states not constitutional system now is. i was concerned about november. i'm concerned about now. nothing has happened since has changed way i see things. sr: let's talk about how evolution takes place. you've written about how 'post-truth pre-fascism.' talk about leaders ignoring facts, law history. how far along progression we? i'm wondering where might see things going next. ts: that's tough because what history does give whole bunch cases where democratic republics become authoritarian regimes; sometimes fascist regimes, sometimes communist regimes. doesn't give one storyline: a, b, c, d. gives bunch clusters a, bunch clusters c. but factuality really important more important than people realize, because it's substructure regime change. we think about democracy, that's word americans love use, democracy, that's how we characterize our system. but if democracy just means going vote, it's pretty meaningless. russia has democracy sense. most authoritarian regimes have democracy sense. nazi germany had democracy sense, even after system had fundamentally changed. democracy only has substance if there's rule law. is, if people believe votes going counted they counted. if they believe there's judiciary out there will make sense things if there's some challenge. if there isn't rule law, people will afraid vote way they want vote. they'll vote their own safety opposed their convictions. so thing we call democracy depends rule law. things we call rule law depends upon trust. law functions 99 percent time automatically. functions because we think it's out there. that, turn, depends sense truth. so there's mechanism here. can get right heart matter if can convince people there no truth. which why stuff we characterize post-modern might dismiss actually really, really essential. second thing about 'post-truth pre-fascism' i'm trying get people's attention, because actually how fascism works. fascism says, disregard evidence your senses, disregard observation, embolden deeds can't proven, don't have faith god but have faith leaders, take part collective myth an organic national unity, so forth. fascism was precisely about setting whole enlightenment aside then selling what sort myths emerged. now those [national] myths pretty unpredictable, contingent different nations different leaders so on, but just set facts aside actually fastest catalyst. so part concerns me lot. where we're going? classic thing watch out shift from one governing strategy another. u.s. system, typical governing strategy more or less have follow your constituents legislation because election cycle. that's one pulse politics. other pulse politics emergency. there's some kind terrorist attack then leader tries suspend basic constitutional rights. then we get different rhythm, where rhythm not one electoral cycle next but one emergency next. that's how regime changes take place. it's classic way since reichstag fire [when nazis burned their nation's capitol building blamed communist arsonists]. so terms what might happen next, or what people could look out for, some kind event government claims terrorist incident, would something prepared for. that's why it's one lessons book. sr: have talked before about kind emergency justification--and even vladimir putin russia. what think would happen here? because exception judiciary, lot american institutions, like congress, not really resisting. they're going along. ts: they're going along... but my own intuition would emergency situation arises because going along isn't going enough. paradoxically, congress going along going pass bunch stuff, which not actually very popular. right? it's not going so popular have millions people lose health insurance, which what's going happen. ironic things about republican congress now has ability do everything wants do, but none what wants do popular. except few big lobbies, course. freedom republicans have freedom impose their agenda down. same thing goes mr. trump. things he might do some people would like, like building wall or driving all immigrants out, those things going difficult or slow. case wall, i personally don't believe will ever happen. it's going very slow. so my suspicion much easier have dramatic negative event, than have dramatic positive event. one reasons i am concerned about reichstag fire scenario. other reason we being mentally prepared by all talk about terrorism by muslim ban. very often when leaders repeat things over over they preparing when meme actually emerges reality. sr: i want change topic slightly. cite many examples from germany 1933, year hitler consolidated power. so what did ordinary germans miss that's relevant ordinary americans now? i know some blurring facts. but when i have talked holocaust survivors, they often say, nobody ever thought things would bad, or nobody thought germans would go far they did. ts: german jews then, people now, don't understand how quick their neighbors will change; don't understand how quickly society can change. they don't understand fact life that's been predictable long time, doesn't mean will predictable tomorrow. people like think their experience exceptional. german jews might have thought, 'well, there were pogroms [ethnic cleansing] russia, but surely nothing like could happen here.' that's what many german jews thought. so one issue people need realize how quickly things can change. second thing german jews were not aware of, or germans were not aware of, was how new media can quickly change conversations. way, it's not exactly same, but radio at time often ended up being channel propaganda. there parallels internet now, where there were hopes would [primarily] enlightening. but fact, turns out presidential tweets, or bots, or isolated habits viewing, isn't necessarily enlightening. it's opposite. lot us were blindsided by internet much same way people could blindsided by radio 1930s. but here's other view. one we have german jews didn't have 1933 we have their experience. that's premise whole book; premise 20th century showed us what can happen, there's lots wonderful scholarship by german historians others, which breaks down what can happen how. so, one first things we should doing taking advantage one opportunity we really have they didn't, which learn from history. that's premise book. sr: all your book's lessons very personal: don't obey advance. believe truth. stand out. defend institutions. calm but courageous can be. yet change or oppression talking about systemic institutional. what do say people who say, 'i'll try, but i may not have power here.' there's cliche, tilting at windmills. ... ts: well, if everyone tilted against windmill, windmill would fall down, right? party tragedy don quixote he's tilting against wrong thing. so that's not our problem. we're pretty sure what problem is. but he was also alone except his faithful companion. we're not really alone. there millions millions people who looking thing do. just by sheer math, if everyone does little thing, will make difference. much what i am recommending is--you're right, they things people can do, but they also involve some kind engagement. whether it's small talk [with those disagree with] or whether it's corporeal politics. little bit engagement helps realize what doing has kind sense, even if doesn't immediately change order. finally, lot political theory i am calling upon, which comes from anti-nazis anti-communists, makes point even though don't realize it, your own example matters whole lot, whether it's positively or negatively. there times, one those times, where small gestures, or their absence, can make huge difference. so things might not have mattered year ago do matter now. basic thing we making difference whether we realize or not, basic question whether positive or negative. let me put different way. except really dramatic moments, most time authoritarianism depends some kind cycle involving popular consent some form. really does matter how we behave. danger [if] we say, 'well, we don't see how matters, so therefore we going just table whole question.' if we do that, then we start slide along start doing things authorities expect us. which why lesson number one is: don't obey advance. have set table differently. have say, 'this situation which i need think myself about all things i am going do not just punt. not just wait. nor just see how things seems me. because if do that, then change actually become part regime change toward authoritarianism.' sr: cite book something i read high school: eugene ionesco's existential play about fascism, rhinoceros, where people talk about their colleagues at work, academia, saying stuff like, 'come on, i don't agree everything, but give him chance.' ionesco's point people join an unthinking herd before they know it. what would suggest people do, when they run into others who fall spectrum? ts: there few questions here. one how keep yourself going. another how energize other people who agree you. third thing not quite rhinoceros stuff, but how catch people who slipping. like cnn coverage last week speech congress, where one cnn commentators said, 'oh, now presidential.' was rhinoceros moment, because there was nothing presidential--it was atrocious parade victims crimes committed by one ethnicity. was atrocious there's nothing presidential about it. catching rhinoceros moments one thing. i think it's really important think about. example ionesco gives people saying, 'yeah, one hand, jews, maybe they right.' trump, people will say something like, 'yeah, but taxes, maybe he's right.' thing catch is, 'yeah, but favor regime change? favor end american way democracy fair play?' because that's what's really at stake. people all way over at end spectrum who now confident about trump--that's different subject. i think it's important maintain impossible human relations across divide, because some those people going change their minds. it's harsh. but some will change their minds, if they have no one talk to, will much harder them change their minds. at different points spectrum, have think different ways. my own major concern right now self-confidence energy people who do have deep--and, i think incorrect--conviction something has gone wildly wrong. sr: people who have conviction something has gone wildly wrong--that can describe trump supporters trump opponents. ts: that's good point. so much personal. book, i don't actually mention anybody's name, except thinkers who i admire. so much personal people think, 'well, if say anything critical, about person, how don't like anything about someone who likes trump.' that's way there no political discussion. i think it's useful, even though will never win argument, when talking about people who support administration, stay at level constitution. stay at level freedom, or stay at level basic issues, like, global warming really going so great, when entire pentagon says national security threat? or, really such good idea treat muslims like this? or, really going so good when millions people lose health insurance? keep at level issues much possible, because what i've found pattern people shift is, 'why going so hard guy? give him chance.' but issues what's constitutional, what actually american, what's going policy they going proud year from now--keep conversation closest constitution. it's easiest dismissed when it's personal. fundamentally, trick. isn't personal. doesn't matter who's charge. what matters system, which people very different convictions take granted, now under threat. sr: have said muslims being targeted jews were targeted germany. but out here california, also feels like deportation machinery getting ready undocumented immigrants. monday, reuters reported homeland security officials said they might separate mothers from kids when making arrests. germany did rounded up jews. don't they face just grave threat? ts: muslims, resemblance anti-semitic policy germany '33 if can pick some group make them stand some international threat, then can change domestic politics, because domestic politics then no longer about compromises competing interests, domestic politics about who inside society should actually seen outside society. once get wedge first group, them essentially win. could muslims. could somebody else, point. political logic basically same. undocumented immigrants, i think logic might little bit different. i think goal might get us used seeing certain kind police power. getting us used seeing things happening people public. then if we get used that, then we might more willing dial turn little bit further. it's too soon me speculate confidently about all this. i think you're right though, could muslims, but doesn't have muslims. crucial thing get some kind [political opening] where people go along or accept stigmatization. logic there's always some kind threat comes from beyond country. we can fix threat group people inside country. if go along this, what else agreeing go along with?

""more than those who hate you, more than all your enemies, an undisciplined mind does greater harm."" - buddha there no doubt about - there can no happiness while we enslaved by our own shadows. no factor seems more important our wellbeing than state our minds. yet, average person up 70% ones thoughts negative self-talk. leads emotional overload stress. ""ok, i get it"", i hear say, ""but how control mind?"". thing is, cannot control first thought arises mind any given situation - simply conditioned response. but can exercise control over second thought ones after. here lies your power (and responsibility). example, i'm sitting couch sunday afternoon thought arises ""i'm lonely"". whether i ""accept"" continue train thought (""yeah, nobody loves me..."", etc.) or simply let pass, its my choice. i can also choose instead think ""yes, i'm alone at moment, but its good, i need some self-space"". one way leads anxiety, victimization self-pity - other doesn't. thousands times per day we make choices like this, although most times automatic we not aware it. becoming aware our mind processes exercising our power direct our attention mastery mind. greatly facilitated by practices such meditation mindfulness. there also techniques developed by psychologists. message, here, way feel, way think, not necessity. merely learned habit. is, great part, arbitrary. have power change it. giving power your thoughts by thinking them, by engaging conversation them, believing them. if they creating suffering, remember have power think something different. mind cannot hold two opposite feelings at same time, so focusing developing positive thought patterns emotions already goes long way. watch mathieu ricard (ex-phd scientist turned monk) expand this. action step: become aware your internal dialogs. vigilant your negative thoughts. next time negative thinking kicks in, exercise your power redirect your thoughts something else, reinterpret facts, or simply ignore. beginning will succeed only few seconds. practice persistence, however, becomes natural easy. part 2 - mindset & attitudes some mindsets empower life success fulfilment; others create difficulties pain. these can learned by experience (the hard way), by reading good personal development material, by engaging mentors life coaches, or by reflection meditation. here my findings from these learning paths. 11. face everything an opportunity grow. probably most empowering attitude i've ever encountered. good medicine against many causes fear, frustration, impatience, anxiety, stress. if face every event, every challenge, part way, then nothing can disturb you. will not fear, nor complain, nor blame, nor pissed off by things happen. instead, your mind there will only question: ""what can i learn from this?"". an event doesn't mean anything by itself; always only what make it. have power make positive or negative. get ""no"" an answer. your car breaks. it's raining sunday again. can't finish your project. got sick. nobody buying your product. your son doesn't listen you. can resist these things. close yourself up. fight them. now have problem, unfortunate. or can open. breath deeply. acknowledge what there. look your lesson, next step. now simply have new context, an opportunity. performance psychologist john eliot, author somewhat controversial overachievement, has very interesting expression: ""eat stress like an energy bar"". yes, even emotions like stress, anger, envy, can used something positive, motivators action. depending our attitude these energies can empowering or disempowering. life's challenges polishing you, preparing bigger things. action step: next time challenge comes, kiss its face, learn lesson, move on. 12. expectation creates disappointment expectation wishful thinking about future. sets self-imposed standard what happen. bit like drawing line sand deciding ""if above line i'll happy; if not, i'll upset"". some expectations natural, not harmful. when i buy product from supermarket, i expect not rotten, will have an unpleasant surprise if is. other expectations, however, just recipe disaster. instance, expecting things easy when learning something, or working my business, or trying navigate through life, will create lot frustration. if, instead, i expect things hard, i'll well prepared. if they turn out easy, i'm happy; if they turn out hard... well, no surprises here. after all, usually what worth having doesn't comes easy. similarly, hoping get lucky, accepted, have quick success, have no conflicts - all these expectations bring about pain. we'd better off just doing what we need do leaving future take care itself. while may impossible live without any expectations at all, when we learn more conservative ""soft"" about our expectations, we suffer less consequences their violation. keeping mind they arbitrary self-imposed, we tend have more flexibility flow. manage your expectations, will rarely disappointed. check out also create posts about subject lifehacker, huffington post tiny buddha. action step: what needless expectations imposing yourself right now? do really need them? 13. yesterday graveyard... how forget past reinvent your history victimization, remorse, guilt, regret. no doubt these unhappy feelings, they all have something common: they anchored past. what dwelling on? your past failures? betrayal? gaffe made last dinner party? something unjust happened you? past good one thing only: learning. we need reflect what has happened, learn from it, move on. your past does not define - unless allow to. not what has happened you; what choose become. mind defines you. mind creates what constantly thinks about. suddenly over thinking past doesn't sound like good idea anymore... usually pain (and not pleasure), keeps us looking back. desire ""correct"" past one main reasons why we get stuck it. yet desire goes against basic law nature. if we reflect deeply about how tendency hurting our present, how hindering our life here now, we will have motivation needed make decision let go stop looking back. course, if possible also helps get physically apart from places people who take back your past. another approach actually reinvent your past. yes, possible, not hallucination. fact is, past we remember what we have subjectively experienced, not raw facts. facts + our thinking/feeling. not reality, but rather our colourful description - we have power change this. if somebody did something bad us, we cannot start believing they simply didn't do (we actually can, but that's delusional); but we can change our belief about what means us. basically changes everything, because rest our life we will remember our story event, it's ending, not experience event. morty lefkoe, author best-seller re-create your life, teaches process can used reinterpret past events simple way: identify undesirable pattern name underlying belief identify source belief memory, including much sensory detail possible describe possible alternate interpretations memory realize your original belief an interpretation, not reality consciously choose reject original belief ""false"" consciously choose accept your reinterpretation ""true"" both interpretations valid. your reality will defined by one choose accept. your choice. action step: identify where your past usually get stuck in, go through reinterpretation process. 14. accept things cannot control or change whether we like or not, many things life we cannot change. we cannot change other people, nor behaviour market. other things can changed, but only colossal effort during long period time. accepting reality not passive attitude. does not make us weak. does require humility, course, but empowers us respond life wiser, more effective, way. we cannot fight all battles. so let's choose wisely what accept, what focus change. action step: struggling accept some major reality yourself or your life? what would happen if instead asking ""how can i change this"" asked ""how can i make use this?"" 15. move direction your fears yes, read right. have determination no fear must arise unmet. have obsession every fear must confronted conquered. unleashing your inner hero will deepen your life broaden your heart. fear one most instinctive human emotions. can take many forms, such worry (fear about future circumstances), doubt (fear about making wrong choice) hatred (the aggressive response feared object). most likely will experience your whole life, so might good idea learn how deal it. problem not fear arises. problem, if any, how respond it. yes, believe or not, have total freedom how respond. maybe hard experience it, because might not have exercised mind-muscle much. but it's there. experiencing danger & risk, can character building well. even your kids. smooth sea never made skilled sailor. skilled sailors have depth their live novices don't. happy those bigger than their fears. how bigger than your fear? act bigger than your fear. when doubt, close your eyes take leap. don't cling something just because fear. makes prisoner. hey! fear not big deal. just some electrical impulses your brain, coupled bit chemicals running through your blood. will keep powerless while life runs by? action step: think something makes afraid. take one small step every day direction fear. it's important small step, otherwise may lose motivation. feel confidence comes from acting despite fear. gradually increase boldness your actions. 16. embrace impermanence not understanding accepting impermanence cause unhappiness. impermanence fundamental law our existence. only thing certain life: everything changes. time eats away everything, nothing remains same. your time will spent. money will gone. many things cared about will either disappear, or will no longer care about them. good news whatever negative feeling or unpleasant situation experiencing will also pass. there was time when did not exist; then shows up limited time, after goes back not existing. several ancient traditions emphasised need contemplate fleeting nature our lives, from buddha stoics (who called exercise memento mori). deeper life opens up when we understand embrace impermanence our mortality, learn its lessons. deep (and often unnoticed) fear our hearts released once we accept impermanence down our bones. result we get more focused, we freed up live more amazing life. action step: spend some time reflecting about how everything constantly changes. think something very attached to, or situation bothering you. realize too shall pass. 17. happy thoughts - choosing optimism, choosing happiness yes, wellbeing happiness matter choice. ""habits thinking need not forever. one most significant findings psychology last twenty years individuals can choose way they think."" - martin seligman from learned optimism wonderful book author explains difference between optimism (much vogue) ""positive thinking"": former learning new set cognitive skills, while later repeating ""positive affirmations"" yourself. skills we need learn changing our ""explanatory styles"", which how we chose talk ourselves when interpreting what's happening. following experiment was made two dogs. first dog slightly shocked but has lever he can push stop shocks. he quickly learns stop shocks. he's good ""psychological"" shape. second dog does not have lever, so he can't stop shocks. his shocks stop only when first dog hits his lever. so, effect, shocks random him. our second dog ""learns"" he helpless face these shocks. here's what's fascinating: dogs then moved new area taught new way avoid shocks. so, now they can both avoid shocks at will. remarkably, although first dog avoids shocks, second dog curls up corner whimpers shock - which he could have avoided - administered. he has learned helplessness. second dog may feel sorry himself. he may blame first dog. he may complain. all these disempowering. or he may learn see things differently. we condition ourselves through our own self-talk, then become prisoners our interpretations, blind reality. whether tell yourself can or can't, right. why if want create instant change your life, watching your self-language seems great place start. how describe your reality how define it, how create it. here model author proposes an optimist explanatory style: permanence - what happened likely continue? optimists think if it's bad thing it's fluke. if it's good thing, they tend think it's permanent. opposite holds true pessimist: good things flukes bad things more likely recur. - what happened likely continue? optimists think if it's bad thing it's fluke. if it's good thing, they tend think it's permanent. opposite holds true pessimist: good things flukes bad things more likely recur. pervasiveness - does reflect your whole life? ""universal"" or ""specific""? good event, optimist more likely extend her whole life. bad event, she will tend isolate incident specific situation. opposite holds true pessimist. - does reflect your whole life? ""universal"" or ""specific""? good event, optimist more likely extend her whole life. bad event, she will tend isolate incident specific situation. opposite holds true pessimist. personalisation - internal or external? something good happens. an optimist pats himself back (internal), thinking he did good job. if same thing happens pessimist, he more likely attribute success luck, other people's hard work, or something else outside his control (external). how we interpret events can maximise happiness energize us, or make us feel terrible. good news is: it's our power decide. an emotional intelligence skill can developed. course, many situations life call dose pessimism, caution, ""defensive thinking"", so our optimism should not blind us either. like anything excess, irrational optimism also harmful - though arguably less harmful than irrational pessimism. so maybe section should called ""choosing balanced optimism"". true optimism more reaction present than an expectation about future. not about blindly believing things will always turn out he best. violates principle managing your expectations (see point 12). true optimism about choosing interpret events positive light when they do happen. not being attached past negative talk. being open anything can happen, yet at same time confident ""i can do something positive anything comes"". there several studies how being optimistic positively affects physical mental health (1, 2), romantic relationships, athletic performance, career, business economy. check out article read more optimism & positive psychology, one about how happiness also deliberate choice. action step: identify three places your life having negative self-talk. how could have more empowering interpretation situation? negative self-talk based reality now, or mere learned habit? 18. wrong needing right all time can extremely limiting energy consuming. having courage vulnerable accept one's mistakes liberating. whether accept not, reality many times will wrong. by saying, ""i was wrong"" more often - yourself others - will find more compassion, humility flexibility. people will trust more. good always aim highest - long we understand perfection unattainable, both work relationships. nothing perfect; even earth not perfectly round. will invariably make bad decisions. understanding how often we wrong makes us more compassionate towards ourselves. we see many times we simply did best we could at time - we need educate ourselves, not punish ourselves. we will also tend criticise others less, more empathetic, which will improve our social relations. humility pays off. personally, was not easy me accept practice lesson. but once i tried few times, i started taking pleasure it. there certain unburdening heart happens, which makes worth even if only feeling. my values points view were changing by time, even something opposite, i saw contradicting myself was sign growth, not confusion or unreliability. action step: hard accept being wrong? if so, try this: look back see some opinion had now see was wrong. or maybe some bad decision. then clearly express were wrong person involved situation. depending magnitude what happened, ""little"" act can save relationship, company, life. 19. have some trust one qualities developing your spirituality trust something larger than yourself. call god, universe, dharma, life - doesn't matter. it's not about whimsical expectation things will happen according your preference, but faith things will happen favor your greater good. it's conviction that, if put your best foot forward, universe will respond. does one really need trust? no. but life more beautiful it. trust something larger accomplishes four important things: makes optimistic (section 17) decreases your worries doubts, allowing forget about future focus more present forces accept things cannot change takes out your little world less prone mental masturbation ""what if..."" there also scientific evidence trust makes us happy. here podcast episode where one my guests speaks about value surrender. action step: time take leap faith somewhere your life? how would your feelings actions different if had more trust? 20. dare disagree ""it's always better at bottom ladder want climb than top one don't"" marc angel chernoff. free yourself from crowd mentality. lion. will not find happiness life sheep - at most comfort. lion finds his own path, or carves one out if none found. sheep follows beaten road. lion walks alone if needed, fearless. sheep fearful moves herds. lion roars loud clear. sheep's sound weak hesitant. lion rests deep, confident he can handle any challenge. sheep worried about tomorrow. lion makes news. sheep reads news. lion creates innovates. sheep follows standards repeats patterns. lion will fight, even though wounded. sheep will run, even before fight.

beijing. nguyen phu trong, general secretary communist party vietnam (cpv), was treated much same manner during his official trip china last week. yet, while mr trong's visit was aimed at developing stronger ties china, does not mean communist leadership hanoi pursuing duterte-like pivot beijing. closer ties beijing trong's four-day trip, which started january 12, was his first china since being re-elected cpv's leader at its 12th national congress january 2016 his first foreign tour 2017. he went beijing high-ranking delegation included four politburo members charge four important departments vietnam's one-party regime - namely central propaganda, foreign affairs, national defense public security. during visit, hanoi beijing reached wide range agreements aimed at strengthening cooperation between two ruling parties two communist neighbors various fields at many levels. trong's outing was followed by recent notable trips asian juggernaut by other vietnamese top officials - including prime minister nguyen xuan phuc dinh huynh, cpv's permanent secretary, september october 2016, respectively. mr huynh, an influential politburo member, tipped succeed trong if 72-year old leader chooses step down near future. all these journeys suggest hanoi attaching greater importance its cooperation beijing adopting more friendly posture toward latter than about six or seven months ago. combination factor may contribute change. one these fact china vietnam's closest neighbor, sharing not only land sea borders but also many political economic similarities former. world's most populous country also vietnam's biggest trading partner. given all these, coupled vietnam's power asymmetry vis-a-vis its giant neighbor, country's stability - perhaps cpv's survival - steadying its ties beijing always priority hanoi. chinese leaders' current charm diplomacy also influencing hanoi's posture. mr trong was first foreign leader china received 2017. he was given red-carpet welcome upon his arrival at beijing international airport an official welcoming ceremony full honors at great hall people beijing january 12. five seven members all-powerful standing committee politburo communist party china (cpc), including president xi jinping premier li keqiang, held talks him. mr phuc was given similar treatment when he toured china last september. warm reception chinese leaders extended their vietnamese ""comrades brothers"" indicates beijing also highly valuing hanoi its relations latter. this, return, increasing vietnam's trust - or at least, decreasing its mistrust - beijing encouraging develop tighter ties china. seems tensions suspicion caused by china's actions recent years, notably its placement its huge oil rig, hs-981, vietnam's exclusive economic zone 2014, have now eased. overt overtures made toward beijing by several regional countries, particularly malaysia philippines, another defining factor. last november, malaysian prime minster najib razak made six-day trip china. during visit, which was intended elevate their relationship ""greater heights"", kuala lumpur beijing signed many new agreements, including malaysia's first major defense deal china. two weeks before that, president rodrigo duterte also made landmark trip beijing, where he eventually solemnly announced his ""separation from us"" his ""dependence"" china, after months publicly denouncing washington praising beijing. malaysia's turn toward beijing especially philippines' dramatic tilt away from its long-standing most important ally china's orbit somehow influenced rethink hanoi. like vietnam, malaysia philippines have outstanding territorial disputes china south china sea. years, they were among region's most vocal critics their northern neighbor's expansive claims aggressive actions resource-rich strategically vital water. they all favored multilateral approaches maritime disputes. hanoi supported philippines's south china sea arbitration welcomed its landmark legal victory against china last july. duterte's wholehearted embrace china, which resulted his side-lining july ruling agreeing enter bilateral talks beijing prompted vietnam soften its posture improve relations china. last but not least, donald trump's shock rise american presidency also key reason behind hanoi's current accommodating posture toward beijing. under obama administration, vietnam america edged remarkably closer each other. their stronger ties were strengthened by - manifested - many key developments agreements. prominent among these mr trong's unprecedented trip washington 2015, president obama's milestone visit vietnam 2016, during which he officially ended america's decades-old arms embargo its former war foe, vietnam's enthusiastic response america's asia pivot us-led tpp. vietnam's strong economic strategic ties us have been jeopardy following trump's election victory. faced imminent collapse tpp other uncertainties about america's relations asia vietnam under trump, hanoi relatively readjusting its foreign policy improving its ties beijing can seen part such recalibration. but not duterte-like shift yet, while becoming more receptive beijing, hanoi not bandwagoning latter; because many reasons. one these concerns vietnam's economic imbalance china. though has dropped recently, vietnam's trade deficit world's second biggest economy remains enormous. according its general statistics office (gso), 2016, vietnam exported (us)$21.8 billion goods world's largest trading country imported $49.8 billion from it. means had trade deficit $28 billion china last year. years, hanoi has asked beijing help balance bilateral trade by creating better conditions vietnamese goods enter chinese market. reported his talk nguyen phu trong, xi jinping promised china will work harder make two countries' trade relations grow faster become more balanced. whether vietnam's companies their goods provided greater access china following trong's visit remains seen. yet, any case, will take years or decades, if ever, vietnam balance its trade china. reason - order avoid economic overdependence its giant neighbor sustain its economic development - vietnam needs good relations its other major trading partners, notably european union us, which has enjoyed huge trade surplus recent years. 2016, vietnam exported us$34 billion (in goods) eu, its third largest trading partner, us$38.1 billion us. america vietnam's biggest export market second largest trader, while unclear how donald trump will view approach his country's relations vietnam, certain hanoi will try its best sustain improve its ties washington. another reason why vietnam seeking better relations us other powers, including japan india, its unresolved maritime disputes china. during trong's china visit, both sides pledged manage maritime differences avoid any acts may complicate situation escalate tensions south china sea. nevertheless, after ""candidly"" exchanging their views issue, they could not yet accept each other's main position. according report by vov, vietnam's national radio broadcaster, his talk his chinese counterpart, trong ""asserted vietnam's consistent stance persistently dealing dispute east sea [vietnam's name south china sea] by peaceful measures compliance international law, including 1982 united nations convention law sea (unclos), respect diplomatic legal processes."" contrast, manifested by its vehement objection philippines' arbitration case, beijing has stringently opposed any legal approach resolve disputes. instead, has forcibly insisted bilateral negotiations. their joint communique mentioned neither these two positions. given china's expansive claims its past recent actions south china sea, vietnam does not expect - though strongly hopes - beijing will willingly accept peaceful solution dispute based principles international law, including unclos. why has hedged - continues hedge - against any aggressive move by china by forging strong ties global regional powers, notably those also concerned about beijing's hegemonic ambitions. supported by fact whilst trong was holding talks chinese leaders beijing, hanoi nguyen xuan phuc received john kerry. latter's visit might not have major impact future us-vietnam cooperation. yet, his talk outgoing us secretary state, vietnamese premier expressed his delight at achievements us-vietnam relations vietnam's desire reinforce bilateral ties. shows vietnamese leadership really values its relationship washington. just day after trong returned from china, hanoi received shinzo abe. their separate meetings japanese prime minister, southeast asian country's top four leaders - party chief, state president, prime minister parliament chairwoman - all affirmed hanoi's desire deepen economic strategic ties japan. his part, during two-day visit, mr abe pledged provide vietnam six new coastguard patrols. patrol vessels, worth $338 million, were part $1-billion loan tokyo offered hanoi. vietnam-japan relations have significantly advanced recent years mainly due their shared concerns over china's maritime ambitions actions. such apprehensions have also brought vietnam closer india, china's other key regional rival. six months ago, before phuc's china trip, hanoi hosted prime minister narendra modi. during landmark visit, first official trip vietnam by an indian prime minister since 2001, two countries elevated their ""strategic partnership"" ""comprehensive strategic partnership"" new delhi agreed provide vietnam $500 million defense loan. all these demonstrate while may prioritize relations beijing, hanoi also seeking stronger ties other powers, notably us, japan india, counterbalance china, both economically strategically. also evident vietnamese leadership not overtly leaning toward beijing submitting latter's maritime position president duterte has done. following duterte's china visit last october, during which he publicly promised shift his country's allegiance from washington beijing, some international relations experts, notably those from china, predicted america's other asian partners, such vietnam, may follow suit. ahead trong's visit last week, an article global times, spin-off people's daily, cpc's mouthpiece, also suggested shift diplomacy by philippine leader ""sets good example other southeast asian countries, including vietnam."" judging by mr trong's assertion vietnam's maritime position his talk chinese leader other diplomatic strategic moves recently taken by hanoi, apparent vietnamese leaders not following mr duterte's steps or ""example"". instead, they remain firmly committed their long-held foreign policy independence, diversification multilateralization has enabled vietnam develop good - generally fruitful - relations many countries, including all world's major powers region's countries. <url>",<date>,<date>,<date>,vietnam tilting
